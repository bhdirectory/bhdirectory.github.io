      <p>A television set is provided in each room but residents are welcome to bring their own set if they wish.</p> <p>Birtley House has a communal Sky dish for residents wishing to have access to satellite television. If a resident wishes to move their current Sky TV subscription service to Birtley House, or they wish to sign up for a new subscription, then they should contact <a href="https://www.sky.com/">Sky Customer Services</a> on 03300 413 000. Sky will then provide them with a set-up box.</p>
      <p>Each of our bedrooms has a suitable socket into which a Sky box can be connected. Provided there is an active card inserted into the Sky box, then Sky services can be accessed.</p>
