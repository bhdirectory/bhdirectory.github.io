    <section>
      <p>A television set is provided in each room but residents are welcome to bring their own set if they wish. Birtley House has a communal Sky dish for residents wishing to have access to satellite television. If a resident wishes to move their current Sky subscription service to Birtley House, or they wish to sign up for a new subscription, then Sky Customer Services will need to be contacted on 03300 413 000. Sky will then provide them with a set-up box. Each of our bedrooms has an appropriate socket into which a Sky box can be connected. Provided there is an active card inserted into the Sky box, then Sky services can be accessed.</p>
