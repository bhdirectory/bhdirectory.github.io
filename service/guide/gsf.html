            <p>GSF is a way of working that has been adopted at Birtley House, along with hundreds of other homes across the UK, enabling a ‘gold standard for care’ for all people nearing the end-of-life. It involves all staff working together as a team and with other professionals, to help provide the highest standard of care possible for our Residents and their families as they face the last stage of their lives. This includes support that is high quality, reliable and consistent, helping our Residents to live well and die well in the place and manner of their choosing.</p>
