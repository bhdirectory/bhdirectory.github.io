            <p>All in-house laundry is provided free of charge by the Nursing Home. Personal laundry is collected daily and is usually returned within 48 hours. All dry cleaning is sent away on a Friday and returned the following Friday. These items should be given to the Housekeeping staff separately. Dry cleaning is charged for as supplied.</p>
            <p>All clothing should be clearly marked with the residentâ€™s name. We can offer a labelling service if required. This is a chargeable service.</p>
            <p>The Home will make every effort to prevent damage to clothing but regret that we are unable to guarantee that delicate items such as cashmere and items made from natural fibres (other than cotton), will not be affected by the laundering process. We would advise residents that they should avoid bringing with them items made from wool or silk as, if these become soiled and cannot be dry-cleaned, they will have to be cleaned through the usual laundry process on a hot wash (in line with our infection control policy) and this could result in them being damaged beyond repair. Birtley House cannot be held liable in this instance.</p>
