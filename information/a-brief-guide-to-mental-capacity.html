        <p>It is vital that you know which of our residents lack capacity at any particular point in time.</p>
        <p>You must presume that all other residents have capacity and make every effort to support them to make their own decisions, even if they seem to you to be unwise or eccentric.</p>
        <p>If, having applied these principles, you suspect someone may be lacking capacity, then you should report this to our nursing team who will arrange for a mental capacity assessment and document this in the residentâ€™s Care Plan.</p>
        <p>If that person is deemed to lack capacity, then a best interest meeting will be held with a range of relevant people close to that person in order to determine the least restrictive intervention to maintain their safety and dignity.</p>
        <p>When a person lacks the capacity to understand what they need to be kept safe, Sylwia will make a DoLS application specifying the restrictions needed and we should all be aware of what constitutes a restriction in this context and to whom they apply.</p>
