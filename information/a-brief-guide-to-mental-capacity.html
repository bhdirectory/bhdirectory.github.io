        <h4>It is vital that you know which of our residents lack capacity at any particular point in time.</h4>
        <p>You must <strong>presume</strong> that all other residents have capacity and make every effort to <strong>support</strong> them to make their own decisions, even if they seem to you to be <strong>unwise</strong> or eccentric.</p>
        <p>If, having applied these principles, you suspect someone may be lacking capacity, then you should report this to our nursing team who will arrange for a <strong>mental capacity assessment</strong> and document this in the residentâ€™s Care Plan.</p>
        <p>If that person is deemed to lack capacity, then a <strong>best interest meeting</strong> will be held with a range of relevant people close to that person in order to determine the <strong>least restrictive intervention</strong> to maintain their safety and dignity.</p>
        <p>When a person lacks the capacity to understand what they need to be kept safe, Sylwia will make a <strong>Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS)</strong> application specifying the restrictions needed.  We should all be aware of what constitutes a <strong>restriction</strong> in this context and to whom it applies.</p>
