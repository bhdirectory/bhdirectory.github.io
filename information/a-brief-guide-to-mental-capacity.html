        <span style="font-size: larger; color: rgb(0,116,132);">It is vital that you know which of our residents lack capacity at any particular point in time.</span>
        <p>You must <span style="font-size: larger; color: rgb(0,116,132);">presume</span> that all other residents have capacity and make every effort to <span style="font-size: larger; color: rgb(0,116,132);">support</span> them to make their own decisions, even if they seem to you to be <span style="font-size: larger; color: rgb(0,116,132);">unwise</span> or eccentric.</p>
        <p>If, having applied these principles, you suspect someone may be lacking capacity, then you should report this to our nursing team who will arrange for a <span style="font-size: larger; color: rgb(0,116,132);">mental capacity assessment</span> and document this in the residentâ€™s Care Plan.</p>
        <p>If that person is deemed to lack capacity, then a <span style="font-size: larger; color: rgb(0,116,132);">best interest meeting</span> will be held with a range of relevant people close to that person in order to determine the <span style="font-size: larger; color: rgb(0,116,132);">least restrictive intervention</span> to maintain their safety and dignity.</p>
        <p>When a person lacks the capacity to understand what they need to be kept safe, Sylwia will make a <span style="font-size: larger; color: rgb(0,116,132);">Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS)</span> application specifying the restrictions needed.  We should all be aware of what constitutes a <span style="font-size: larger; color: rgb(0,116,132);">restriction</span> in this context and to whom it applies.</p>
