            <p>Each room or apartment is allocated a key worker from among the care staff whose duty is to spend quality time once a week with each resident. This could be talking to them in general, helping them sort out clothes, helping with shopping lists or going out for a walk etc. The keyworker is expected to document what he/she has done with each resident on a weekly basis.</p>
