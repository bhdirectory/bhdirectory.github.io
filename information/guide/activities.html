            <p>At Birtley we pride ourselves on maintaining a busy, varied and interesting programme throughout the year, full of imagination and thought.</p>
            <p>The aim is to attract as many residents as possible to join in the structured activities or outings which take place five times a week. The Activities team are available throughout the day thus providing the opportunity for residents to discuss any personal problems or requirements.</p>
