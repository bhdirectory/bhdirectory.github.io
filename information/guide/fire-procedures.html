            <p>There is a weekly fire alarm test, usually on a Wednesday afternoon. A notice in the Reception Area (Main Hall).  The alarm will ring on two occasions for approximately 30 seconds. Residents and visitors are not required to evacuate the building.  There has been significant investment in reducing the risks of fire in the Home and all staff are made aware of the dangers and trained in emergency procedures. The Home is protected by a comprehensive fire detection system and access-controlled doors. We have a ‘stay-put’ policy in place for our residents.  Every bedroom provides at least 30 minutes of fire and smoke protection and residents should remain where they are until assistance arrives. Residents should not attempt to leave the building unassisted.</p>
