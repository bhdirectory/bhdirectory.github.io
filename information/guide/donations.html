          <h4>The Birtley House Community Fund</h4>
            <p>Through funds raised we are able to help support various local community projects and charities such as the halow project, the CWC (Care Workers Charity) and Horatio's Garden. We tend to support projects which fall into one of the following categories:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Supporting local community activities with a preference for projects supporting rural/village communities;</li>
              <li>Improving facilities, services and activities for older people;</li>
              <li>Providing training, development and intergenerational learning opportunities for local people;</li>
              <li>Environmental – Projects which conserve or improve the wildlife value of Surrey or which improves community access to and awareness of the environment;</li>
              <li>Charities which help to enrich the life and wellbeing of our staff.
            </ol>
          <h4>Staff Fund</h4>
            <p id="staff-fund">Chairman Simon Whalley also receives contributions throughout the year in recognition of the support our staff give to residents and their families. At Christmas time this is distributed, without deductions, to all staff at Birtley House ensuring whether they have direct contact with residents or not, each one is able to enjoy a fair share of the Fund – based entirely on workload not seniority.  Any voluntary contributions should be made by cheque to Simon Whalley.</p>
