This may be overriden by the personal choice of an individual for a divan bed (to be provided by the resident) providing this does not conflict with the ability of our staff to provide safe and effective care. There are a range of different bed types including those that can be lengthened for tall residents or those that can be lowered to the floor where there is a risk of a resident rolling out of bed.  All EPBs have compliant bed rails which can be used if necessary as a restriction provided the resident consents to this or is suitably assessed in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act. There is a rolling programme of bed replacement for equipment that is obsolete or no longer serviceable.  All spare parts are sourced from the manufacturer themselves or suitable suppliers"
