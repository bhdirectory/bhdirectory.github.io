document.write("\<i style="color: black"\>06/03/2019\<\/i\> - A comprehensive review of all the EPBs has recently been completed and a register of beds provides information about all EPBs in the Home.  The register corresponds with tags that have been attached to each bed for identification purposes. Similarly, a QR barcode (located on each bed handset) provides a link to the specific web page of the asset from where details of the bed can be found including links to user manuals.  A monthly check has been devised, but has not yet been initiated.  This is due to start in \<i style="color: black"\>April 2019\<\/i\>");
