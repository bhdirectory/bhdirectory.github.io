          <p>All residents have access to a <a href="http://www.possum.co.uk/products/nursecall-logger/">nursecall system</a> intended for making efficient requests for services from Nursing and Care Staff as well as for summoning help in the event of an emergency.  The standard call bells provided include a < a href="http://www.possum.co.uk/products/atom-2/">neck pendant</a> (which can alternatively been worn around the wrist) and a < a href="http://www.possum.co.uk/products/wall-family/">static unit</a> affixed to either bedroom wall (with a cabled press button for flexible positioning to suit the resident) or to the ensuite wall (with a pull cord).  Additional devices include <a href="http://www.possum.co.uk/products/sensormate/">sensor mats</a>, PIR units and other monitors which will be assessed and deployed according to need.  The supplier also has a range of <a href="http://www.possum.co.uk/products/qwayo/">environmental control solutions</a> which could be used in specific cases.  All calls are transmitted to <a href="http://www.possum.co.uk/products/infopager/">individual 'pager' units</a> that care staff carry throughout their shift.  In addition, a centrally located display shows current active bells.  The nursecall system has a logger which produces reports every 24 hours.  These reports are audited once a month to better understand how the system is being used.  The logs provide a means of investigation should a concern about the responsiveness of the bell system be raised.</p>
