document.write("\<i\>06/03/2019\<\/i\> - Water temperature checks are being conducted on a monthly basis for all residential rooms and outlets that are controlled with TMVs.  Monthly sentinel checks are not being done every month, although this is the intention.  Improvements to the checking regime are scheduled to begin from March 2019.  Quarterly descaling of spray outlets is being completed by the Housekeeping Team who also carry out weekly flushing of little used outlets (eg. if a room is unoccupied).  The next risk assessment is due in March 2020.  The register of water outlets is incomplete but under development.");
