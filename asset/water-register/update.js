document.write("\<i\>06/03/2019\<\/i\> - Water temperature checks are being conducted on a monthly basis for all residential rooms and outlets that are controlled with TMVs.  Monthly sentinel checks are not being done every month, although this is the intention and improvements to the checking regime are scheduled to begin from March 2019.  Quarterly descaling of spray outlets is being completed by the Housekeeping Team who also carry out weekly flushing of little used outlets (eg. if a room is unoccupied).  The next risk assessment is due in March 2020.  The register of water outlets is incomplete but under development.  Currently the only outlet that has a concern is on the second floor of the House on a mixer tap at a small kitchenette unit where a TMV placed locally is conflicting with the mixer tap's own control and reducing the temperature of the hot water supply.");
