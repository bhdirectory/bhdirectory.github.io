        <h3>Fire Safety Arrangements</h3>
        <aside>
          <p>A substantial upgrade to the automatic fire detection system took place in 2016 making the system fully addressable and compliant to the appropriate <a href="certification/L1-certificate.pdf">L1 standard</a>.  A comprehensive <a href="fire-risk-assessment.pdf">Fire Risk Assessment</a> has been carried out by a third-party.  Recommendations have been actioned according to an <a href="fire-improvement-plan.pdf">Fire Safety Improvement Plan</a>.  There is a <a href="alarm-system/service-agreement.jpg">service agreement</a> in place with Elite Fire Ltd.</p>  The company has a <a href="/policy/fire-safety-policy.pdf">Fire Safety Policy</a> and <a href="fire-action.jpg">Fire Action</a> and <a href="/policy/evacuation-procedure.pdf">Evacuation Procedures</a> have been drawn up.  All staff undergo an annual Fire Awareness Training.  Staff with additional responsibilities have further training, including use of emergency evacuation equipment.
