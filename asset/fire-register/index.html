The fire incident that occured in November of last year have been followed up with a Fire Safty Visit by the Surrey Fire & Rescue Services who felt that the incident had been handled satisfactorily and made no further recommendations.  We continue to improve the frequency of testing of emergency lighting.  We have identified a couple of EL units in the Main Kitchen not operating correctly and these have been scheduled for repair.  We are also due an annual 'drop-test' to ensure that all EL units operate on battery load.  Fire doors remain an area for improvement.  We are in the process of creating a register of fire doors after which regular inspections can be completed.  There are a number of acoustic door closers that are proving problematic for a variety of reasons.  A proposal for staged replacement of these unit has been completed by a third-party specialist and this investment is being considered at Board level.  In the meantime, the issues identified by the weekly door test are rectified as far as possible at the time.  The fire risk assessment is due an annual review and this is being scheduled by our Facilities Management firm, HunterFM.  There remain a couple of outstanding fire safety-related recommendations to complete from last years combined FRA and H&S assessment including additional emergency lighting in communal bathrooms and for the labelling of some fire doors.  Insurance requirements relating to fire safety include the annual sweeping of chimneys and the cleaning of the extract fan in the kitchen.  Both have been completed in recent months.  The tumble dryer flue is cleaned at least quarterly and the lint trays are managed by the Laundress or Housekeeping staff on a daily basis.  A test of portable appliances has been completed for 2019.  Staff are fully trained in fire awareness each year and additional training is provided for Nursing staff and night staff who have additional responsibilities.  Selected staff have been trained in the use of vertical evacuation equipment.  Additional Evac Sleds are being considered after positive feedback from the training of staff for the one located on the Second Floor of the Main House"
