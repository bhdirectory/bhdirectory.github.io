    <h4>Function Test</h4>
      <p>This test is performed monthly by our Maintenance Team and involves using a test switch connected to each light unit to ensure that the lamp will light in the event of a power cut.  In addition, the test will ensure that the unit is charging correctly (by displaying a charging LED indicator) and that the unit is clean and any associated signage is correctly displayed.</p>

    <h4>Drop Test</h4>
      <p>An annual 'drop test' puts each unit through a minimum of three hours of battery operation to ensure that the battery is taking a full charge and will work satisfactorily in the event of a power cut.</p>
