document.write("\<i\>15/03/2019\<\/i\> - Daily visual checks are well embedded.  A monthly function test has been completed March.  There are three failures, two lighting units that are currently without test swicthes due to refurbishment work, although both have been installed by our electrician in the last couple of weeks and are functional.  Work to install the test swicthes is due to be completed within a couple of weeks.  One unit in the Annexe has a failed battery and will be actioned as a priority. An annual drop test is overdue. The refurbishment work in the Main Hall will alter the arrangement of emergency lighting in this location with individual bulkheads being replaced by double spotlights mounted in the loft above the glass roof.  The emergency light levels for this new arrangement have been measured and is satisfactory.");
