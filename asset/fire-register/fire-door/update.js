Weekly checks on all automatic door closers takes place at the same time as the weekly fire alarm test.  Recent results regularly show a number of doors that are not closing satisfactorily.  Adjustments and repairs are conducted on the doors affected at the earliest opportunity.  In addition, a quote has been obtained for the replacement of all acoustically operated fire doors with hard-wired solutions that would be more reliable.  This quote has not yet been approved.");
