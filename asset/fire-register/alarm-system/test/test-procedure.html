    <p>Two staff members are required to conduct the test. They should be designated as Tester 1 & Tester 2.*</p>
    <p>Tester 1 should proceed to the first designated Call Point and activate the device.</p>
    <p>Tester 2, located at the Fire Panel in the Front Entrance Hall, should allow the bells to ring for at least three seconds, then unlock the panel using the panel key and silence the alarm before resetting it immediately.</p>
    <p>Once the first test has been completed, Tester 1 should proceed to the second designated Call Point and activate the device in the same way.</p>
    <p>For this second test, Tester 2 should allow the bells to ring for at least ten seconds prior to silencing and resetting the panel. This extended sounding allows for the operation of all the acoustically-triggered Automatic Door Closers throughout the property.</p>
    <p>On completion of the second test, Tester 1 should conduct a complete sweep of the building to ensure that all Automatic Door Closers have functioned correctly.</p>
    If all the tests have been successful, please submit a 'PASS' email from the relevant device's data page.</p>
    <p>If any issues have been identified during the test, they should be recorded in submission of a 'FAIL' email from the relevant device's data page.</p>
    <p>NB. Responsibility for the completion of the weekly test is shared equally between the two designated Testers.</p>
    <p>NB. The Call Points designated for testing are specified at the <a href="../index.html">Fire Alarm System Index</a>.</p>
