            <p>There are three passenger lifts.  These are serviced and maintained by a specialist third-party under a <a href="contract.pdf">comprehensive contract</a> that allows for monthly inspection visits.  The lifts are subject to annual LOLER examinations from an independent engineer arranged as part of a comprehensive <a href="/asset/loler-register/qa/inspection-service.pdf">Engineering Insurance Policy</a>.  Emergency lowering instructions are located at each lift control panel.  The service provider should be called in the event of a breakdown or emergency situation.</p>
