          <p>The company has a <a href="">Working at Height Policy</a> and <a href="/risk/risk-register/working-at-height.pdf">risk assessment</a>.  Only staff who have undergone ladder training should use a ladder.  The need for the use of a ladder should be determined by a risk assessment, although for straightforward daily tasks such a changing a lightbulb, hanging a picture or storing something on a high shelf, such an assessment will be done at the time by the individual using the ladder or step-ladder.  Maintenance, Housekeeping and Kitchen staff undergo suitable training and have access to ladders and step-ladders.  For all work involving platforms, trestles or scaffolding, RAMS will be provided before work starts.  This applies to contractors working on site as well.</p>
