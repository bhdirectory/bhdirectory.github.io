                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                      <p>Asbestos should only be disturbed or maintained by suitably trained personnel, who will be licensed contractors, working under strictly controlled conditions.  In order for the risks to be adequately controlled, a knowledge of what asbestos containing materials (ACMs) may be present, their location and condition. This has been done by way of a surveys undertaken by a specialist firm (Appendix A) and is monitored by the Company through regular visual inspections (Appendix B). The results of the specialist survey have been used to produce this management plan which prescribes regular checking of the condition of the ACMs and controlling any building or repair works to ensure it is not disturbed, except by specialists under controlled circumstances.

                    <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                      <p>Within the regulated environment of the Nursing Home, the Registered Manager is responsible for all activities.  Overall and final responsibility for safety matters is that of the Board of Directors.  The Health & Safety Co-ordinator who has prepared this plan.  The members of the Maintenance and Housekeeping Departments, who are authorised to access the relevant restricted area have a responsibility to understand the hazards, follow the specified procedures and maintain suitable controls.  Any contractors authorised to work in the restricted areas (by way of a Permit to Work) also have a responsibility to understand the hazards, follow the specified procedures and maintain suitable controls.

                    <h3>Action Plan</h3>
                      <p>Given the condition and location of the ACMs and the use of the buildings, the decision has been taken to leave the asbestos in place and introduce controls to prevent it being disturbed.
                      </p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            <h4>Controls</h4>
                              <p>Asbestos labels will be attached to all ACMs.  Any works proposed which will affect the ACMs must first be approved by the Health & Safety Coordinator or Registered Manager.  Contractors carrying out such work will need to be licensed and demonstrate their competence before being allowed to start.  A full risk assessment and method statement will need to be produced, including disposal arrangements for the waste and a Permit to Work issued prior to any work starting.  Any asbestos waste disposed of must be properly documented and copies of consignment notes filed with the Company.  Amendments to the Asbestos Management Plan must be made.  The condition of any ACMs will be monitored regularly in accordance with the Asbestos Management Plan.  If it is found to be damaged or becoming friable, the area will be evacuated until the risks are reassessed and controlled.
                              </p>

                              <p>The Maintenance Assistants will be given awareness training and briefed on what action to take if any asbestos is accidently disturbed (see Emergency Procedures below).
                              </p>
                          </li>
