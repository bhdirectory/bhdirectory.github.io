Please could you have another look at Wisteria door as this malfunctioned yesterday evening.

 

Could you also let me know if we will be replacing the chair in 43 with one of the new ones or whether there was a different solution?

Thanks,

Tim

I have confirmed with Frank that we can move excessive flammable materials into Hurst Hill for the time being.  Please could we do this as soon as convenient.

Thanks
