[[Bramley,_Surrey|Holy Trinity Church]] in [[Wikidata:Q1776917|Bramley]] had been a daughter church of [[Wikidata:Q4831198|Shalford]] but finally became a separate [[Wikidata:Q102496|parish]] in 1847. This was followed by the development of parish buildings, including the [[Wikidata:Q3914|school]] and [[Wikidata:Q39614|cemetery]] for which, in 1849, Henry Street sold the land for £600.

In the [[Wikidata:Q7809952|tithe map]] of 1843 Birtley House appears as a moderate, compact [[Wikidata:Q879050|manor house]] with a [[Wikidata:Q42811590|farmyard]] and out-buildings clustered round its north-east aspect at the end of a drive which corresponds to the line of the current main entrance. Birtley Farm (now redeveloped) was built prior to 1860 (some of the buildings have been dated to the 17th century) and most of the original farm buildings around the main house were demolished to make way for the [[Wikidata:Q517820|Coach House]] and a stable yard. By 1871 the gardens to the south-west had been extended and a [[Wikidata:|vine house]] and a [[Wikidata:|conservatory]] added. The vine house still exists and is used for [[Wikidata:Q25308|Orchids]] and [[Wikidata:Q1385709|seedling]] growing, but the [[Wikidata:Q1791429|conservatory]] was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the construction of the West Wing as accommodation for Dick and June Whalley’s four children.

The Street family lived the quiet life of country gentlemen at Birtley for two hundred years without achieving any great distinction - though one, John, did marry [[Wikidata:Q309759|Edward Lear]]’s sister in 1811.  Their son Charles later emigrated to [[Wikidata:Q664|New Zealand]] and named his house in [[Wikidata:Q37100|Auckland]] “Birtley” preserving a memory of the family home; the property is now a [[Wikidata:Q22746|public park]].

There was one occasion when the quiet life at Birtley was disrupted. The daughter of the then [[Wikidata:Q2188542|Shere]] & [[Wikidata:Q4712853|Albury]] [[Wikidata:Q6415017|rector]] (her name was Lucy Duncomb) married another John Street in 1780 aged only 18. By the age of 26 she had had 5 children (the eldest of whom was the one who married Miss Lear) but must have had her head turned by the life of a [[Squire|squire]]’s wife – or maybe she began to feel neglected - for she started a flagrant affair with a married man from [[Wikidata:Q1776917|Bramley]]. He would visit her in her bedroom (probably now our Wisteria Apartment) when John was away on business but John’s [[Wikidata:Q13472752|valet]] betrayed her to his master and they were caught on an assignation in Farmer Elliot’s field (the Elliots still farm at [[Wikidata:|Grafham]]) and Lucy was made to hand over her keys and never allowed back to Birtley despite several attempts at a reconciliation with her husband. She blamed her mother-in-law for blackening her name but she seems to have been very reckless and not very good at judging people as her lover instantly deserted her too!
