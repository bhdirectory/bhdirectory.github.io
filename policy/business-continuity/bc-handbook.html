      <h1>Business Continuity Handbook</h1>
        <h2>About this Handbook</h2>
          <aside>
            <p>Unforeseen accidents, emergencies and disasters do occasionally occur. The Company believes that it is important that its staff are prepared for such events so that they can respond to them quickly and effectively to safeguard both residents and staff. The Company also believes that in such circumstances it is vital that managers and staff know exactly what to do and that preparations are made to cover all eventualities. Birtley House Nursing Home adheres fully to the requirements of the Care Act 2014 which sets out Safe Working Practices and Regulations for Care Homes for Older People.</p>
            <p>It is important for you to read the Handbook carefully as you are expected to comply with all the policies and procedures contained within it from time to time. These can be changed at any time by the Company and new or updated policies will be communicated to you.</p>
            <p>The information covers a wide range of subjects relating to your employment and in the event that information in this Handbook conflicts with your <dfn title="A contract is an agreement that sets out an employee’s employment conditions, rights, responsibilities and duties.  These are called the ‘terms’ of the contract">Contract of Employment</dfn>, the Contract will take precedence.<p>
            </p>If you have any questions or any part of the Handbook is unclear to you, please do not hesitate to raise any queries with your <dfn title="Manager, in this context, refers to your line manager or any member of the Senior Management Team or a Director.">Manager</dfn>.</p>
            <p>It is important that you do this before signing that you have read, understood and are willing to abide by all the Company's policies and procedures.</p>

          <h2>Business Continuity Policy</h2>
            <aside>
              <p>How quickly – and painlessly – you manage to get back to ‘business as usual’ in the event of a terrorist attack, fire, flood or other natural disaster, or any other major interruption, depends on how effectively you can devise, and put into action, your own business continuity management.</p>
              <p>Business continuity management can best be defined as: <blockquote>‘A holistic management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organisation and provides a framework for building resilience with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of its key stakeholders, reputation, brand and value-creating activities.</blockquote> (Business Continuity Institute, 2001).</p>
              <p>Building-in business continuity, making it part of the way that you run your business, rather than having to ‘firefight’ any emergency, helps prepare you to offer ‘business as usual’ in the quickest possible time. Planned business continuity management, so that your staff, customers and suppliers are reassured that you have an effective policy and practice for managing the unexpected, helps build confidence in your business.</p>
