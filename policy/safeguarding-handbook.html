        <h2>Safeguarding Adults (Prevention of Abuse) Policy</h2>
          <aside>
            <p>This policy has been drafted with reference to <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/contents/enacted">The Care Act 2014</a>, <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/9/part/5/enacted">Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 (Part 5)</a>, <a href="https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/social-care-and-health/care-and-support-for-adults/contact#concerns">Surrey Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH)</a>, <a href="http://www.surreysab.org.uk/#">Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board (SSAB)</a>, <a href="https://www.adass.org.uk/safeguarding-policy-page">The Association of Directors of Social Services (ADASS)</a> and the Deaprtment of Health and Social Care's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/care-act-statutory-guidance/care-and-support-statutory-guidance#safeguarding-1">Care and Support Statutory Guidance</a>.</p>
            <p>Birtley House recognises the six guiding principles of safeguarding:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Empowerment – residents are supported in making their own decisions and choices with informed consent.</li>
                <li>Protection – information, support and representation are provided for those in need of it.</li>
                <li>Prevention – action should be taken before harm occurs.</li>
                <li>Proportionate response – proportionality and consideration of human rights must be used in response to any risk or occurrence of abuse.</li>
                <li>Partnership and community response.</li>
                <li>Accountability and transparency.</li>

              <h3>Safeguarding Policy Statement</h3>
            </header>
                <p>At Birtley House we expect our residents to live in an environment that is safe, supportive and free from abuse. Each will be able to participate in the life of the Home, without fear of any kind of abusive behaviour being directed towards them. All persons living or being cared for, working at, or visiting this home will be treated with respect for their individuality and human rights. Each person will, therefore, conduct him or her self in such a way that they can cause no offence to any other.</p>
                <p>A culture of zero tolerance towards abuse will be maintained and the Managers will ensure that staff concerns are dealt with confidentially, thoroughly and fairly. Any abuse of power or privilege, whether perpetrated by staff, visitors or residents, will be dealt with promptly.</p>
                <p>Abuse takes many different forms, and occurs in all cultures, all religions and all social classes.  This policy is a guidance document for staff to ensure they are aware of the various types of abuse, to enable them to recognise the signs that abuse may be occurring and outlines the actions they should take if they suspect that abuse has occurred or may occur.</p>
                <p>The organisation is committed to the aims of adult safeguarding:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>prevent harm and reduce the risk of abuse or neglect to adults with care and support needs;</li>
                    <li>stop abuse or neglect wherever possible;</li>
                    <li>safeguard  adults  in  a  way  that  supports them  in  making  choices  and  having  control about how they want to live;</li>
                    <li>promote an approach that concentrates on improving life for the adults concerned;</li>
                    <li>raise public awareness so that communities as a whole, alongside professionals, play their part in preventing, identifying and responding to abuse and neglect;</li>
                    <li>provide  information  and  support  in  accessible  ways  to  help  people  understand  the different types of abuse, how to stay safe and what to do to raise a concern about the safety or well-being of an adult;</li>
                    <li>address what has caused the abuse or neglect.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>To contribute to meeting these aims, we will:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Manage our services in a way which minimises the risk of abuse occurring;</li>
                    <li>Work with adults with care and support needs and other agencies to end any abuse that is taking place.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>To achieve these aims we will:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Ensure that all managers, employees and volunteers have access to and are familiar with this safeguarding adult policy and procedure and their responsibilities within it;</li>
                    <li>Ensure concerns or allegations of abuse are always taken seriously;</li>
                    <li>Ensure the Mental Capacity Act is used to make decisions on behalf of those adults at risk who are unable to make particular decisions forthemselves;</li>
                    <li>Ensure  all  staff  receive  training  in  relation  safeguarding  adults  at  a  level  relevant  to their role;</li>
                    <li>Ensure  that  people  using  our  services,  and  where  relevant  their  relatives  and  their friends,  have  access  to  information  about  how  to  report concerns  or  allegations  of abuse;</li>
                    <li>Ensure there is a named lead person to promote adult safeguarding awareness and practice within the organisation This policy and procedure has been developed to be consistent with the <a href="http://www.surreysab.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SSAB-Policy-and-Procedure-2018-FINAL-v2.0-agreed-on-240518-updated-07.08.18.pdf">Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board Adult Safeguarding Policy and Procedures</a>.</li>

              <h3>The Definition of Abuse</h3>
                <aside>
                  <blockquote>Abuse is a violation of an individual’s human and civil right by any other person or persons.</blockquote>
                  <p>Incidents of abuse may be multiple, either to one person in a continuing relationship or service context or to more than one person at a time. Some instances of abuse will constitute a criminal offence.  Criminal charges can be brought against the abuser under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. In addition, statutory offences have been created which specifically protect those who may be incapacitated in various ways. Examples of actions which may constitute criminal offences are assault, whether physical or psychological, sexual assault and rape, theft, fraud, or other forms of exploitation, and certain forms of discrimination, whether on basis of race or gender.</p>
                  <p>Registered Nurses are bound by the NMC Code of Professional Conduct; standards for conduct, performance and ethics (2018), which states that they are responsible for ensuring that they safeguard the interests of their patients at all times.</p>
                </aside>
            </header>
              <p>The currently recognised forms of abuse have been broadly defined under the following categories:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Physical Abuse</strong> – <i>The non accidental infliction of physical force that results (or could result) in bodily injury pain or impairment.</i><br />Examples of behaviour: hitting, slapping, pushing, burning, physical restraint, harassment, enforced sedation, inappropriate use of medication, and catheterisation for management ease.</li>
                  <li><strong>Sexual Abuse</strong> – <i>Direct or indirect involvement in sexual activity without consent</i><br />Examples include:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Non Contact: looking, photography, indecent exposure, harassment, serious teasing or innuendo, exposure to pornography.</li>
                      <li>Contact: 	rape, sexual assault or sexual acts to which the vulnerable adult has not consented, could not consent to, or was pressured into consenting. This includes either physical behaviour or remarks of a sexual nature, made towards the client. Examples include touching the client inappropriately or engaging in sexual discussions which have no relevance to the clients care.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Neglect and Acts of Omission</strong> – <i>Ignoring or withholding physical or medical care needs.</i><br />Examples include: Failure to provide appropriate food, shelter, heating, clothing, medical care, hygiene personal care, appropriate medication.</li>
                  <li><strong>Psychological/Emotional Abuse</strong> – <i>That which impinges on the emotional health and development of individuals</i><br />Examples include shouting, swearing, threats, insulting, humiliation, intimidation, ignoring, coercion, denying the right to privacy or choice, blaming or harassment.  This type of abuse is often present alongside other forms of abuse.</li>
                  <li><strong>Financial/Material Abuse</strong> - <i>The unauthorised, fraudulent obtaining and improper use of funds, property or any resources of a vulnerable person</i><br />Examples include borrowing property or money from a client or client’s family member, withholding client’s money or possessions and the inappropriate handling of, or accounting for, a resident’s money or possessions.</li>
                  <li><strong>Disciminatory Abuse</strong> - <i>Abuse of individual rights is a violation of human and civil rights by any other person or persons</i><br />Discriminatory abuse consists of abusive or derisive attitudes or behaviour based on a person’s sex, sexuality, ethnic origin, race, culture, age or disability or any other discriminatory abuse.</li>
                  <li><strong>Professional/Institutional Abuse</strong> - <i>Professional Abuse is the misuse of therapeutic power and abuse of trust by professionals, the failure of professionals to act on suspected abuse/crimes, poor care practice or neglect in services, resource shortfalls or service pressures that lead to service failure and culpability as a result of poor management systems/structures</i><br />Examples of behaviour; Entering into a sexual relationship with a resident, failure to refer disclosure of abuse, poor, ill-informed or outmoded care practice, failure to support vulnerable adult access to health care/treatment, denying vulnerable adult access to professional support and services such as advocacy, service design where groups of users living together are incompatible, punitive responses to challenging behaviours, failure to whistle-blow on issues when internal procedures to highlight issues are exhausted.  The systems and practices in place in the home should be for the residents benefit not for the staff or the homes benefit. Choice where ever possible should be given, and person centred care plans should be used for each resident.</li>
                  <li><strong></strong> - <i>It is also recognised that “self-neglect” can also become an issue and should be identified and engaged with appropriately, taking in to consideration a person’s human rights and privacy concerns</i>.</li>

        <h2>Adult Safeguarding Procedures</h2>
          <aside>
            <p>In our organisation we will meet the aims of Making Safeguarding Personal:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Keeping the person at the heart of the process;</li>
                <li>Making  efforts  to  understand  the  outcomes  they  want  to  achieve  from  the  adults safeguarding work and support them to achieve those.</li>
              </ul>

            <p>Where a person knows or has a concern that a vulnerable adult has been abused and/or may be the victim of a criminal offence there is a duty and responsibility to contact the police or social services. People with concerns are also able to contact <a href="https://www.pcaw.org.uk/">Protect- formerly Public Concern at Work</a>.</p>

              <h3>Possible Signs of Abuse</h3>
            </header>
                <p>The following is a list of general indicators of abuse:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Unexplained injuries or injuries where the description of the “accident” and the injuries do not correspond.</li>
                    <li>The person is quiet and withdrawn.</li>
                    <li>The person is nervous and eager to please.</li>
                    <li>Bruising, particularly to shins and forearms.</li>
                    <li>Withdrawal from physical contact.</li>
                    <li>Appears agitated and anxious, and seeks isolation.</li>
                    <li>Cuts and tears to skin.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>This list is not exhaustive - if in even the slightest doubt, talk to a senior staff member you trust for advice on the situation. The conversation will be in the strictest confidence</p>

              <h3>Responding to a Disclosure</h3>
            </header>
                <p>Any individual becoming aware of potential abuse should take action to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Listen to what the vulnerable adult is saying;</li>
                    <li>Safeguard the vulnerable adult, alerting emergency services if necessary;</li>
                    <li>Record the words of the vulnerable adult and accepting the statements as truth, record the full details, including the time, date and location that the disclosure was made. All written notes must be made as soon as practicable and kept;</li>
                    <li>Discuss and negotiate with the vulnerable adult as to who will be informed and why.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>The initial conversation should be regarded as a source of evidence. It is therefore important to listen and not ask leading questions which may suggest or invite an anticipated answer, and to record the concerns precisely, as expressed by the vulnerable adult and referrer. This initial conversation may become the basis for a formal interview at a later date.</p>

        <h2>Human Rights & Mental Capacity Act (MCA) Policy</h2>
          <aside>
            <p>The aim of this policy is to ensure that this organisation fully implements the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents">Mental Capacity Act 2005</a> which sets out how service users who lack capacity should be helped to take decisions and under what circumstances decisions might be taken on their behalf when they lack the ability to do so.</p>
            <p>Staff should be aware that the Act introduced a criminal offence of ill treatment or neglect of a person who lacks capacity. Any person found guilty of such an offence may be liable to imprisonment for a term of up to five years. Organisations may also be liable to prosecution under corporate manslaughter provisions if the ill treatment or neglect resulted in or contributed to the death of a person.</p>
            <p>Certain groups of people are legally required to have regard to the Act and its associated <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/497253/Mental-capacity-act-code-of-practice.pdf">Code of Practice</a> when making decisions on behalf of people who lack mental capacity. This includes doctors, nurses, health and social care managers and staff.  The Act applies only to people aged 16 years and over.</p>

              <h3>Background</h3>
            </header>
              <p>The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents">Mental Capacity Act 2005</a> was introduced into England and Wales in April 2007 and fully implemented in October 2007 when a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/497253/Mental-capacity-act-code-of-practice.pdf">Code of Practice</a> was issued. It has great relevance for the provision of health and social care and in protecting the human rights of service users, particularly protecting them from abuse and improper treatment or care.</p>
              <p>The Mental Capacity Act, or MCA as it is often known, was introduced to provide a statutory framework to protect those who lack the mental capacity to make their own decisions, such as those with severe dementia or any other significant brain dysfunction, and those who are dying and no longer capable of making decisions for themselves.</p>
              <p>Most importantly the MCA sets out:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>who can take decisions for people who lack capacity;</li>
                  <li>in which situations this can be done;</li>
                  <li>how they should go about this.</li>

              <h3>Definition of 'Capacity'</h3>
            </header>
              <p>The ‘capacity’ referred to in the MCA refers to the mental capacity to make a decision. Where a person is described as ‘lacking capacity’ this means that the person is judged as being unable to make a decision for him or herself because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain, whether temporary or permanent.</p>
              <p>Importantly, capacity can change and may relate to different decisions differently. Therefore a lack of capacity should never be assumed or presumed.</p>
              <p>A person’s capacity to make a decision can be affected by a range of factors such as a stroke, dementia, a learning disability or a mental illness – or when they are near end of life. A person’s capacity may also vary over time or according to the type of decision to be made. For example, making decisions about what to eat will demand less mental capacity than making decisions about whether or not to have life-saving surgery.</p>
              <p>Physical conditions, such as an intimidating or unfamiliar environment, can also affect capacity, temporarily preventing people from being able to make decisions, as can trauma, loss, medication and health problems.  Lack of capacity may therefore not be a permanent condition.  Assessments of capacity should be time and decision specific. It cannot be assumed that someone lacks capacity based upon age, appearance, condition or behaviour alone.</p>

              <h3>Key Principles of the Act</h3>
                <aside>
                  <p>According to the following principles, which are legally enforceable in law, all staff involved in the care and treatment of a person who may lack capacity must show that they understand the rights of the person under the law and that they have assessed the person’s capacity appropriately. It is particularly important that they understand that a person’s capacity may change over time depending upon the decision to be made and the individual circumstances.</p>
                </aside>
            </header>
              <p>The Act is underpinned by five key principles set out in Section 1 of the Act:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>A presumption of capacity</strong> - every adult has the right to make his or her own decisions and must be assumed to have capacity to do so unless it is proved otherwise.</li>
                  <li><strong>The right for individuals to be supported to make their own decisions</strong> - people must be given all appropriate help to enable them to make their own decisions before anyone concludes that they cannot do so.</li>
                  <li><strong>Individuals must retain the right to make what might be seen as eccentric or unwise decisions</strong> – it is human nature that people sometimes make poor decisions but that does not mean that they should be judged as unable to take those decisions.</li>
                  <li><strong>The principle of ‘best interests’</strong> – anything done for or on behalf of people without capacity must be in their best interests, taking in to account the person’s past and present wishes and feelings.</li>
                  <li><strong>The least restrictive intervention principle</strong> – anything done for or on behalf of people without capacity should be the least restrictive of their basic rights and freedoms.</li>

              <p>At Birtley House  care staff will be trained in the basic principles of the Mental Capacity Act and in its direct application to their work. They should be trained to use the 2 stage test competently and within the underpinning principles framework of the Act.</p>
              <p>All staff will be expected to read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/497253/Mental-capacity-act-code-of-practice.pdf">Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice</a> issued on 23 April 2007 in accordance with sections 42 and 43 of the Act.</p>

              <p>Training will emphasise the need for staff to respect and consider the rights, dignity, privacy, autonomy and freedom of the individual.</p>
              <p>Training should be included in induction and refreshed as necessary. Full records of training should be kept.</p>

                  <p>An <a href="nhs-dols-pathway.pdf">NHS Mental Capacity Act and Deprivation of Liberty Pathway diagram</a> follows the process of assessing capacity.</p>
                  <p>Staff should be aware of Section 2 of the Act which makes it clear that a lack of capacity cannot be established merely by reference to the person’s age, appearance, or any condition or aspect of a person’s behaviour which might lead others to make unjustified assumptions about capacity. Most people will be able to make most decisions, no matter what their age is and even when they have a label or diagnosis that may seem to imply that they do not have mental capacity, such as dementia.</p>
                  <p>Further guidance on the application of the MCA has been published by <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/rp_poc1b2b_100563_20111223_v4_00_guidance_for_providers_mca_for_external_publication.pdf">CQC</a> and <a href="https://www.scie.org.uk/mca/practice/care-planning">Social Care Institure for Excellence (SCIE)</a>

                <h4>The Capacity Tests</h4>
                  <aside>
                    <p>The Act states that any competent person who is aware of the requirements of the MCA can apply the test, they do not have to be a doctor (though professional opinion may be required in complex or major decision cases) or a nurse. The test is Decision-Specific which means that it must be applied for each specific decision. It should never be decided that someone lacks capacity as a result of a particular medical condition or diagnosis and therefore need never be asked. Where used the test should be properly recorded in the service user’s notes.</p>
                    <p>Staff assessing capacity must remember that an unwise or unpopular decision made by the person does not of itself indicate a lack of capacity.</p>
                    <p>A person can put his or her wishes and feelings into a written statement if they so wish, which the person making the determination must consider.</p>
                    <p>If there is a chance that the person will have capacity in the future, the decision should, if at all possible, be delayed until they do.</p>
                  </aside>
                  <p>Staff should use the <strong>2-stage test</strong> set out in the Act for assessing whether, on the balance of probabilities (i.e. it is more likely than not) a person lacks capacity to take a particular decision at a particular time. The <strong>2-stage test</strong> asks:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Is there an impairment of, or disturbance in, the functioning of the person’s mind or brain? If so,</li>
                      <li>Is the impairment or disturbance sufficient that the person lacks the capacity to make that particular decision?</li>
                    </ol>
                  <p>The MCA says that a person is unable to make their own decision if they cannot do one or more of the following four things (the <strong>4-stage test</strong>):</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>understand information given to them;</li><br /><strong>OR</strong>
                      <li>retain the information long enough to be able to make the decision;</li><br /><strong>OR</strong>
                      <li>weight up the information available to make the decision;</li><br /><strong>OR</strong>
                      <li>communicate their decision (in any way, including sign language, blinking, squeezing a hand  or muscle movement).</li>
                    </ol>

                <h4>Recording the Capacity Assessment</h4>
                  <p>A clearly recorded assessment of capacity, with supporting evidence should be kept, where someone is deemed to lack capacity to consent to their care and support plan, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The decision;</li>
                      <li>how the person was assisted to understand the decision;</li>
                      <li>the impairment;</li>
                      <li>how this affects the person’s capacity;</li>
                      <li>whether the decision can be delayed;</li>
                      <li>a reasonable belief (i.e. more likely than not) that the person lacks capacity to make the decision;</li>
                      <li>any referral to the commissioning body if there is a dispute.</li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>Staff should be aware of circumstances in which it is necessary to involve external professionals and agencies, ensuring written records of assessments and decisions are kept and confirmation by the professional is obtained where they are appropriately involved in assessments and decisions.</p>

                <h4>Assessments of Day-to-Day Decisions</h4>
                  <p>Where assessments of capacity relate to day–to-day decisions and caring actions, such as helping someone to wash or get out of bed, no formal assessment procedures or documentation is required. However if a decision is challenged the member of staff must be able to describe why they had a reasonable belief of lack of capacity. Anyone making a decision in the best interests of a person who lacks capacity is specifically warned in the Act not to make assumptions that cannot be clearly justified.</p>

                <h4>Assessments of Highly Significant Decisions</h4>
                  <p>Where the decision is about highly significant matters, such as financial, medical or end of life matters, the assessment process has to be clear and accountable and requires input from staff across the range of organisations involved in providing support for a person. In such cases it should include family and carers and, where there is no family or carer, an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA) may be assigned where appropriate.</p>

                <h4>Restraint & Restrictions</h4>
                  <p>Restraint should only ever be used in compliance with the Act as a last resort or in exceptional circumstances. It is defined in the Act as the use or threat of force where an incapacitated person resists, and any restriction of liberty or movement, whether or not the person resists. It is only permitted if the person using it reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent harm to the person who lacks capacity, and if the restraint used is proportionate to the likelihood and seriousness of the harm.</p>

                <h4>Advance Decisions</h4>
                  <p>Staff should be aware of how the Act relates to Advance Decisions, decisions made by a person in case there comes a time when they no longer have the capacity to make a decision. In such cases the Advance Decision, where properly made, should be acted upon. Further guidance is set out in Birtley House’s policies on end of life care and on advance decisions.</p>

                <h4>Court of Protection & The Public Guardian</h4>
                  <p>In cases where an application should be made to the Court of Protection, the Code of Practice puts the responsibility to do this with the decision-making body.  In accordance with the first principle of the MCA, it should not be assumed that the person is unable to make an application to the court themselves. If the person has capacity to do this, or to instruct a solicitor to do this, they should make the application. In many cases they will need support to do this, and this could be a role that an IMCA or family member fulfils.</p>

                <h4>Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA)</h4>
                  <p>Staff should be aware that in situations where decisions are being made about serious medical treatment for a person who lacks capacity and has no one to speak for them, such as family or friends, the Act makes provision for them to be supported by an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA). The IMCA makes representations about the person’s wishes, feelings, beliefs and values, at the same time as bringing to the attention of the decision-maker all factors that are relevant to the decision. The IMCA can challenge the decision-maker on behalf of the person lacking capacity if necessary.</p>

                <h4>Lasting Power of Attorney</h4>
                  <p>Staff should be aware that the Act allows a person to appoint someone with Lasting Powers of Attorney to act on their behalf if they lose capacity in the future. An attorney must be over 18 and can be a family member, friend, care worker or professional. They are always subject to the provisions of the Act, particularly the core principles and the best interests requirements.</p>

                <h4>Deprivation of Liberty</h4>
                  <p>If a situation arises where a resident requires care, treatment or some form of intervention but they cannot make a decision about this because of a lack of mental capacity, but it is felt in their best interests to proceed with it, we first try to ascertain if it would lead to the person being deprived of their liberty as a result.

          <h2>Deprivation of Liberty Policy</h2>
            <aside>
              <p>From 1 April 2009 any care home or hospital treating or caring for a person in such a way that they are depriving that person of their liberty is required to seek authority to do so.  This document has been written to explain the process that must be followed in order to obtain authorisation if there is not already authority given by the court.</p>
              <p>Deprivation of Liberty is an evolving area with the current processes due to replaced in the near future.  The <a href="state-of-care-dols.pdf">CQC 2017/18 State of Care report</a> covers what good practice in applying DoLS looks like – it emphasises regular training and the importance of the Registered Manager and staff having a good knowledge of DoLS, the MCA and fluctuating capacity. It gives examples of homes where the DoLS authorisation had been removed as capacity improved and the resident regained the ability to make relevant decisions.</p>

                <p>This policy is written in accordance with the regulatory framework provided by the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents">Mental Capacity Act 2005</a>, the <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/Deprivation%20of%20liberty%20safeguards%20code%20of%20practice.pdf">Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Code of Practice 2009</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/497253/Mental-capacity-act-code-of-practice.pdf">Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice</a>.  This policy should be read with the Company's <a href="#policyMentalCapacityAct">Human Rights & Mental Capacity Act (MCA) Policy</a>.</p>
                <p>In particular, this policy aims to ensure the Five Statutory Principles are properly implemented:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established they lack capacity.</li>
                    <li>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help them to do so have been taken without success.</li>
                    <li>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision.</li>
                    <li>An act done or decision made, under the Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or made in, the person’s best interests.</li>
                    <li>Before the act is done, or the decision is made, regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person’s rights and freedom of action.</strong></li>

                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
              </header>
                  <h4>Managing Authority</h4>
                    <p>At Birtley House, the “Managing Authority” is the Registered Manager. The Registered Manager is responsible for all aspects of procedure relating to the Deprivation of Liberty of Relevant Persons.</p>
                    <p>The Registered Manager (Managing Authority) has a legal duty to:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>involve the Relevant Person in every aspect of their care and treatment in accordance with the MCA.</li>
                        <li>inform the Relevant Person if they intend to make a request for an authorisation;</li>
                        <li>inform the Relevant Person when an authorisation has been granted;</li><br /><strong>OR</strong>
                        <li>give information on deprivation of liberty safeguards to the Relevant Person;</li>
                        <li>explain their rights under DOLS, orally and in writing – as per Representative below</li>
                      </ul>
                    <p>The Registered Manager (Managing Authority) must, as soon as possible after authorisation, ensure that the Relevant Person and their representative understand:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>the effect of the authorisation;</li>
                        <li>their right to request a review;</li>
                        <li>the formal and informal complaints procedures available to them;</li>
                        <li>their right to apply to the Court of Protection to seek variation or termination of the authorisation;</li>
                        <li>their right to an IMCA if the representative is not a paid professional representative.</li>
                      </ul>
                    <p>The Registered Manager (Managing Authority) is responsible for informing the representative of any sources of relevant information and support.</p>
                    <p>The Registered Manager will keep a record of the amount of contact between the representative and Relevant Person. If there is not enough contact between the representative and the Relevant Person, the Registered Manager must inform the Supervisory Body.</p>
                    <p>The Registered Manager (Managing Authority) should involve the representative when reviewing the care of the Relevant Person.</p>
                    <p>The managing authority will keep a record of all authorization requests and related information, statistics and details. This data should be made available to the Care Quality Commission and Department of Health if requested.</p>

                  <h4>Supervisory Body</h4>
                    <p>The supervisory body will be the local social services authority (LSSA) arranging, paying for, or contributing to the Relevant Person’s care.</p>
                    <p>Where the Relevant Person is of no fixed abode it will be the local LSSA who will deal with this home.</p>
                    <p>For self/privately funded Relevant Person’s it will be the local LSSA who will deal with this home.</p>
                    <p>If it is difficult to ascertain where the Relevant Person lives, then the Registered Manager will apply for authorisation to the local LSSA.</p>
                    <p>Where the Relevant Person care is paid for by the health authority then the Supervisory Body will be the LSSA associated with the health authority.</p>
                    <p>The Registered Manager is responsible for keeping records of which LSSA is paying for the Relevant Person’s care to ensure that an authorisation request is sent to the appropriate Supervisory Body.</p>
                    <p>The Supervisory Body has a legal duty to:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>give the Relevant Person a copy of the standard authorisation;</li><br /><strong>OR</strong>
                        <li>a copy of the refusal;</li>
                        <li>appoint the Relevant Person’s representative;</li>
                        <li>appoint the Relevant Person’s IMCA.</li>
                      </ul>

                  <h4>Relevant Person's Representative (RPR)</h4>
                    <p>The Supervisory Body will appoint a representative for every person subject to a Deprivation of Liberty authorisation. This person will be independent of the commissioners and providers of their service.</p>

                  <h4>Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA)</h4>
                    <p>An IMCA is an “Independent Mental Capacity Advocate”. Whenever someone who lacks mental capacity to consent to arrangements for their accommodation has no family or unpaid carers, it is necessary that an IMCA be involved to oversee the decision-making process. When applying for authorization, the Managing Authority must inform the Supervisory Body if an IMCA is or should be involved.</p>
                    <p>The Relevant Person’s Representative may also have a right to access an IMCA.</p>

                <h3>Admission</h3>
                  <aside>
                    <p>When a Relevant Person is referred to the home, the Registered Manager will ensure that the referrer identifies any possibility that there may be a need for a deprivation of liberty authorisation. This authorisation should be applied for 28 days before the deprivation of liberty is due to start.  In the case of an admission from the social service or NHS, they will normally inform you well before admission, however, when family arranges a placement or others it is likely that the Registered Manager will need to raise the issue.</p>
                  </aside>
              </header>
                    <p>The Registered Manager will ensure that the potential Relevant Person has their mental capacity to agree to residing at the home assessed. If they lack capacity to consent to the admission then the Registered Manager will require the referrer to supply information about the following:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Does the Relevant Person have anyone with Lasting Power of Attorney?</li>
                        <li>If so, is the LPA for Health and Personal Welfare issues?</li>
                        <li>Does the person have a deputy appointed by the Court of Protection?</li>
                        <li>If so, is the Deputy empowered for Health and Personal Welfare issues?</li>
                        <li>Has the person made any Advance Decisions to Refuse Medical Treatment, which apply to anything, which may happen while they are in the home?</li>
                        <li>Does the referrer know of any wishes and feelings expressed by the Relevant Person, which relate to their care? (These are sometimes called advance statements).</li>
                        <li>Do they have a list of people who should be consulted when a major decision is being made?</li>
                      </ol>
              <footer>
                <p>If it is determined that the pre-admission assessment does not indicate a deprivation of liberty authorisation is necessary but circumstances change on admission then the Registered Manager will follow the urgent authorisation procedure.</p>

                <h3>Identifying if authorisation is needed</h3>
                  <aside>
                    <p>The Registered Manager will ensure that all residents are assessed for a need for authorisation. This will normally be pre-admission but on occasions will be post-admission.  Sometimes a person will be admitted with no need for authorisation but because of changes in their condition the need develops over time. The home’s ongoing assessments will recognise this before deprivation is actually necessary and the Registered Manager will apply to the supervisory body for authorisation.</p>
                    <p>A summary of the process is presented as a flowchart in <a href="referral-for-authorisation-of-dols.pdf">Appendix B: Referral for Authorisation of Deprivation of Liberty</a></p>
                  </aside>
              </header>
                  <h4>Determining a Deprivation of Liberty</h4>
                    <p>The basis for determining whether a person is deprived of liberty is subject to an evolving legal position.  The starting point should be the specific facts of the Relevant Person’s situation.  A range of factors should be considered, including the type, duration, manner and implementation of the measure in question.  Whether there has been a deprivation of liberty will then be a question of degree and intensity.  The “Acid Test” set out by the Supreme Court in Cheshire West, when assessing if the Relevant Person is deprived of liberty, is whether that person is:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Under continuous or complete supervision and control;</li>
                        <li>Not free to leave;</li>
                        <li>Lacks capacity to consent to these arrangements.</li>
                      </ol>

                  <h4>Urgent Life-saving Medical Treatment</h4>
                    <p>This policy also takes in to consideration the recent guidance resulting from the Ferreira court of appeal judgement, of which staff will be made aware.  In light of this guidance, authorisation will not be sought for depriving the Relevant Person of their liberty where the need to do so arises in the context of urgent life-saving medical treatment, in accordance with regulation 17 Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  Such circumstances would arise where:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>The relevant Person lacked capacity to make decisions about their own care as a consequence of their physical health condition (for example, they are unconscious);</li><br /><strong>AND</strong><br />
                        <li>The patient would have been treated the same way irrespective of whether they had the capacity to make their own decisions when conscious; </li><br /><strong>AND</strong><br />
                        <li>If the patient were conscious and chose to leave, they would not be prevented from doing so.</li>
                      </ol>

                  <h4>Indicators of a potential Deprivation of Liberty</h4>
                    <p>If the Registered Manager believes that the arrangements for care MIGHT represent deprivation of liberty, they must apply for authorisation.</p>
                    <p>Points, which MIGHT indicate Deprivation of Liberty, include:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Restraint or sedation on admission where the resident resists.</li>
                        <li>Complete and effective control over care and movement of the person.</li>
                        <li>Control over assessments, treatment, contacts and residence.</li>
                        <li>A decision has been made that the person will not be released to the care of others, or permitted to live elsewhere, unless the staff consider it appropriate.</li>
                        <li>There has been a refusal to let the person live with a relative.</li>
                        <li>The person’s social contacts are determined for them, e.g. they are not allowed contact with particular people including relatives.</li>
                        <li>Ongoing restraint or sedation required.</li>
                        <li>The person receives sedative medication for which they do not have capacity to consent.</li>
                        <li>The person is restricted to a small part of the home.</li>
                        <li>The person receives high level of observation.</li>
                        <li>The person seems to be trying to leave.</li>
                      </ol>

                    <aside>
                      <p>The balance of these issues and others will determine deprivation of liberty.  If none of these apply, then it is unlikely that there is a deprivation of liberty.

                      <p>The best interests of a person subject to a deprivation of liberty will be considered in accordance with the <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/Deprivation%20of%20liberty%20safeguards%20code%20of%20practice.pdf">Code of Practice</a> and the following guidelines:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>All relevant circumstances should be taken in to account.</li>
                          <li>Decisions should not be made on the basis of a person’s age or appearance alone, as this may lead to unjustified assumptions.</li>
                          <li>If there is a chance that the person will have capacity in the future, the decision should, if at all possible, be delayed until they do.</li>
                          <li>The person should be encouraged and helped to join in making the decision when possible.</li>
                          <li>If the decision is about life sustaining medical treatment, it must not be motivated by a wish to hasten a person’s death.</li>
                          <li>The person’s past and present wishes, feelings, beliefs and values must be considered.</li>
                          <li>The views of other relevant people should be considered, in particular:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Anyone the person has asked to be consulted.</li>

                      <p>The Supervisory Body carries out or arranges the assessment and the role of the Managing Authority is to facilitate the assessments. The assessment is in six parts, and must be completed within 21 days, for a standard authorization.</p>
                      <p>Members of staff will cooperate with the assessments carried out in respect of the deprivation of liberty authorisation process. The assessment is vital to protection the rights of the Relevant Person and staff members should do all they can to facilitate the process.</p>
                      <p>The assessors will need to see information held about the Relevant Person to help them come to a decision. This information might include:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Evidence of age.</li>
                          <li>Information about their daily care and treatment.</li>
                          <li>Care plans and risk assessments.</li>
                          <li>Information about illnesses.</li>
                          <li>Contact information for family and others.</li>
                          <li>Forms relating to legal issues, such as the Act.</li>
                          <li>Evidence to show that deprivation is the least restrictive option.</li>
                          <li>Any information regarding mental capacity such as:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Any notes about what the Relevant Person may have said about wishes, views and feelings;</li>
                              <li>Any information about people with a Lasting Power of Attorney for the Relevant Person;</li>
                              <li>Any advance decisions to refuse medical treatment the Relevant Person may have on their file;</li>
                              <li>Other information they consider relevant.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                        </ul>

                      <p>It is possible that an assessment may take place outside normal working hours and staff on duty should be made aware of this.</p>
                      <p>During the assessment, however, staff still have a duty of care to the Relevant Person. They should raise concerns with the assessor if they sense the Relevant Person being assessed, whom they know better than the assessor, is becoming distressed.</p>
                      <p>The time from the point at which the Supervisory Body accepts the referral to the issuing of a standard authorisation should not be more than 21 days.</p>
                      <p>When an urgent authorisation has been granted to the home, the assessment has to be completed within 7 days. Under special circumstances the Supervisory Body can extend this by a further 7 days.</p>
                      <p>To apply for a standard authorisation the Registered Manager must complete <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/676365/form-1-standard-and-urgent-request.odt">Form 1 – standard and urgent request</a>.</p>
                      <p>It is vital that the whole form is completed or the assessment will be delayed or prolonged. The form is to be sent to the Supervisory Body for the Relevant Person or potential Relevant Person.</p>
                      <p>The assessors will submit their reports to the Supervisory Body and an authorisation will be issued. Authorisation can be given for any period up to 1 year. In unstable situations it is likely that the period will be considerably less than one year.</p>
                      <p>The authorisation is an important legal document and must be filed as part of the Relevant Person’s records. The authorisation may include conditions to which the managing authority and all staff must adhere to make the Deprivation of Liberty legal. When authorisation is received, the Registered Manager is responsible for instructing all staff that will have contact with the Relevant Person in any conditions, which apply.</p>
                      <p>This briefing process will be recorded within the Relevant Person’s record. All staff members present at the briefing are to sign the record to provide evidence that the briefing has taken place and they fully understand what is expected of them.</p>

                      <p>The Registered Manager (Managing Authority) has an ongoing duty to review whether or not a Deprivation of Liberty Authorisation is still required.</p>
                      <p>There are three circumstances under which this should be done:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>When there are any changes in a Relevant Person’s condition or arrangements which may indicate a change in their need for deprivation of liberty;</li><br /><strong>OR</strong></br />
                          <li>When a period of authorised deprivation is coming to an end;</li><br /><strong>OR</strong></br />
                          <li>If the Registered Manager (Managing Authority) is not certain about the need for continued deprivation of liberty.</li>
                        </ul>
                      <p>As soon as the Registered Manager (Managing Authority) thinks that they can look after the Relevant Person safely without the need to deprive them of their liberty, they should do so immediately.</p>
                      <p>All decisions in relation to a review should be recorded in the Care Plan.</p>
                      <p>A request for a review will be made to the Supervisory Body using <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/676377/form-10-review-request.odt">Form 10 – review request</a>.</p>

                    <aside>
                      <p>There will be occasions when it is discovered that a person who is already admitted is living under circumstances, which may indicate that they are being deprived of their liberty without a valid authorisation. As soon as this is suspected it is the legal duty of the Registered Manager (Managing Authority) to grant themselves an Urgent authorisation. If there is no authorisation the deprivation would be illegal and the Registered Manager (Managing Authority) would be liable for prosecution. It is essential therefore that action is taken the instant that deprivation of liberty is suspected.</p>

                </header>
                      <p>To grant an Urgent Authorisation the Registered Manager (Managing Authority) must:</p>

                      <p>If the Registered Manager (Managing Authority) is not available to complete and sign the forms, it will be done by one of his/her delegated representatives, the list of these delegated staff is held by the most senior person on duty.</p>
                      <p>The Urgent Authorisation lasts for 7 days. Day one starts the day the authorisation is signed and dated. The Supervisory Body may extend this by a further 7 days in exceptional circumstances. To apply for an extension <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/676366/form-2-further-authorisation-request.odt">Form 2  - further authorisation request</a> must be completed by the Registered Manager (Managing Authority) or their delegated representative, only if they are unavailable.</p>

                      <p>There are separate review arrangements for cases in which the eligibility requirement ceases to be met for a short period of time. For example, if the Relevant Person is detained as a hospital in-patient under the Mental Health Act 1983, the managing authority must notify the supervisory body, who will suspend the authorisation – <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/676374/form-7-suspension-of-standard-authorisation.odt">Form 7 - suspension of standard authorisation</a> is be used.</p>
                      <p>If the Relevant Person then becomes eligible again within 28 days, the managing authority must notify the supervisory body who will remove the suspension. If no such notice is given within 28 days, then the authorisation will be terminated – <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/676374/form-7-suspension-of-standard-authorisation.odt">Form 7 - suspension of standard authorisation</a> is be used.</p>

                <h3>Background</h3>
              </header>
                <p>Birtley House is committed to delivering the highest quality services to its residents and therefore expects high standards from its employees, volunteers, agency staff and contractors. In order to maintain these high standards the organisation considers that a culture of openness and accountability is vitally important whereby staff feel enabled to raise any concerns about any suspected malpractice or abuse within the organisation without fear of reprisal, victimisation or ill-treatment, and where they feel that their concerns will be taken seriously.</p>
                <p>This organisation understands ‘whistleblowing’ to refer to a complaint about suspected malpractice at work made by a member of staff, either to the management of the organisation or to an external regulatory body, such as the <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/">Care Quality Commission</a> (CQC) or the <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/">Health & Safety Executive</a> (HSE), or to the police. Such actions are protected in law by the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/23/contents">Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998</a> which protects employees who justly 'blow the whistle' about their employers where a worker has ‘a reasonable belief’ that their disclosure exposes one or more of the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>a criminal offence;</li>
                    <li>the breach of a legal obligation;</li>
                    <li>a miscarriage of justice;</li>
                    <li>a danger to the health and safety of any individual;</li>
                    <li>damage to the environment;</li>
                    <li>fraud or corruption;</li>
                    <li>deliberate covering up of information tending to show any of the above.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>A clear example in the care sector might be where a member of staff has suspicions about systematic physical, mental or financial abuse of vulnerable service users.</p>
                  <p>According to the law such a disclosure is in the ‘public interest’ and so those making the disclosure should be protected from any subsequent victimisation or ill treatment. The legislation was originally introduced to combat any culture of secrecy or intimidation whereby staff are discouraged from coming forward.</p>
                  <p>Birtley House strongly supports whistleblowing legislation as an important element in rooting out unacceptable forms of malpractice in the care sector and as a critical quality assurance safeguard for residents. The organisation also supports measures which protect whistleblowers from any form of victimisation or ill treatment. It is the position of the Company that any malpractice or criminal activity occurring in the organisation - or the covering up of such activities - is entirely unacceptable and, if discovered, will lead to immediate disciplinary or legal action.</p>

                    <p>Overall responsibility for the implementation, monitoring and review of this policy lies with the Registered Manager of the organisation.</p>
                  <h4>The Registered Manager</h4>
                    <p>The Registered Manager in the organisation has a duty to:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>investigate any alleged malpractice as sensitively and speedily as possible;</li>
                        <li>protect the rights and interests of staff who have ‘blown the whistle’ and are covered by the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/23/contents">Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998</a> and <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/18/contents">Employment Rights Act 1996</a>, as amended by the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/24/contents/enacted">Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013</a>, investigating any allegations of bullying or harassment and taking appropriate action;</li>
                        <li>regularly revise policies and procedures to combat abuse, updating them with current good practice;</li>
                        <li>operate systems of management, supervision, internal inspection, and quality control which are designed to reveal abuse if it exists and encourage a culture and ethos for the organisation which is hostile to any sort of abuse;</li>
                        <li>operate recruitment policies and procedures which identify and exclude from employment in the organisation potential or actual abusers;</li>
                        <li>provide training for staff in all aspects of abuse and protection, including their duties to protect service users from abuse and their rights to protection under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/23/contents">Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998</a> and this <a href="#policyWhistleblowing">Whistleblowing Policy</a>;</li>
                        <li>monitor cases and incidents, analysing trends and patterns and implementing improvements to procedures if an investigation into abuse reveals deficiencies in the way in which the organisation operates or loopholes which could be exploited by abusers;</li>
                        <li>review and update this policy as required.</li>
                      </ul>
                  <h4>Registered Nurses</h4>
                    <p>Registered Nurses are responsible for ensuring that they safeguard the interests of their patients at all times. This responsibility encompasses anything which they delegate to other members of the health care team as specified in the <a href="https://www.nmc.org.uk/standards/code/read-the-code-online/#fifth">NMC Code of Professional Conduct 2018</a>.</p>
                    <p>It is the moral obligation, right and duty of staff to inform either the Registered Manager or the Board of Directors of genuine concerns they may have of:</p>
                      <ul>

                <h3>Public Interest Disclosure Act</h3>
              </header>
                <p>The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/23/contents">Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998</a> (the Act), was introduced to ensure that employees had sufficient legal protection when reporting crime, sexual abuse or harassment in the workplace. Prior to the Act, employees reporting such things risked losing their jobs or being victimised. The Act is designed to protect individuals who might face harassment for disclosing any offences or breaches of legislative or other obligations, unauthorised use of public funds, miscarriages of justice, sexual harassment, health and safety issues or environmental matters.</p>
                <p>The Act protects all employees, including contract or agency workers, whose work is controlled by the employer, allowing them to disclose if they have a genuine and reasonable belief that it is in the public interest.</p>
                <p>The Act ensures that an employee will not suffer any detriment as a result of their disclosure, such as dismissal or the withholding of a pay rise. If they do suffer following a disclosure they may seek redress through an employment tribunal.</p>

                  <h3>Policy Statement</h3>
                    <aside>
                      <p>All staff are encouraged to raise any genuine concerns or suspicions that they might have about any malpractice, suspected crime, breach of legal obligations, miscarriage of justice, danger to health and safety or the environment, financial malpractice (eg fraud, corruption, etc) - or any cover-up of any of these areas.</p>
                    </aside>
                </header>

                  <p>As soon as a member of staff becomes concerned about such an issue they should firstly raise it with the Registered Manager, unless the manager is the potential transgressor, in which case the member of staff should complain to The Board of Directors. Concerns may be raised verbally or in writing.</p>
                  <p>In some cases it is understood that, despite this policy, a member of staff raising a concern will wish to remain anonymous and for the concern to be raised in confidence. In such cases every effort will be made to ensure confidentiality as far as this is reasonably practical.</p>
                  <p>When reporting a concern staff should provide as much information and detail as possible, including names, dates, and any evidence, if any.</p>
                  <p>Whenever the Registered Manager receives a complaint made under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 they must launch an immediate investigation which may or may not involve a referral to the police, the HSE or the CQC, etc.</p>
                  <p>Where a member of staff is raising an issue in good faith and has ‘reasonable suspicions’ that their complaint will not be listened to by the Registered Manager or other managers within the organisation, where they believe they will be unjustly treated because of their disclosure or where they reasonably suspect that the managers themselves are involved in the malpractice, then the disclosure should be made direct to the appropriate regulatory authority such as the HSE or CQC, etc.</p>
                  <p>As a last resort a member of staff may feel that their only recourse is to contact the police. This action should only be taken if the matter has already been raised with the prescribed regulator, where the disclosure is ‘reasonable’ in all circumstances, where it is not made for personal gain and where the member of staff reasonably believes that they will be victimised or the issue ‘covered up’. Staff are advised to take legal advice before taking this step.</p>
                  <p>Where any member of staff believes that they have reasonable suspicions and raises one or more of these issues in good faith and in the best interests of others, then the organisation understands that they will be covered under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/23/contents">Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998</a> and that the organisation has a legal duty to protect them from detrimental treatment, unfair dismissal, ill-treatment, harassment or victimisation, etc.</p>
                  <p>No action will be taken against anyone who makes an allegation in good faith, reasonably believing it to be true, even if the obligation is not subsequently confirmed by the investigation.</p>
                  <p>Any harassment or victimisation of anyone raising a genuine concern in good faith under this policy will not be tolerated and appropriate action will be taken, including disciplinary action.</p>
                  <p>If an internal investigation is conducted within the organisation then the Registered Manager will be responsible for keeping the whistleblower informed about the progress of the investigation and action taken. The Registered Manager may instruct a senior member of staff to undertake this if they know they will be unavailable. Where criminal or disciplinary proceedings occur as a result of the disclosure then the whistleblower may be required to give a written statement or give evidence at a hearing. In such cases the organisation will give full support.</p>
                  <p>If concerns are demonstrated to have been raised frivolously, maliciously, for personal gain or where they were known to be untrue, then the organisation may take disciplinary action against the person making the claims or, in the case of agency staff, the agency contract may be terminated.</p>

                <h3>Procedure for raising a concern</h3>
              </header>
                <p>The CQC sets out the following 4-step guide for raising a concern:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>If you see an unsafe practice, risk or wrongdoing, can you tackle it yourself, there and then? A firm, polite challenge is sometimes all that is needed.</li>
                    <li>Talk to your line manager about the problem if possible, or someone senior in the organisation.</li>
                    <li>If you do not feel able to raise your concern with your line manager or other management, consult your own organisation’s whistleblowing policy, if there is one, and follow that.</li>
                    <li>If you have tried all these, or you do not feel able to raise your concern internally, you can raise your concern in confidence with us at the CQC on 03000 616161 or via enquiries@cac.org.uk.</li>
                  </ol>
                <p>In summary, raising a genuine concern about the safety of patients or care standards is justified where done so reasonably and honestly, even if mistaken.  Staff may wish to obtain independent advice first, or contact a trade union or professional regulatory body.</p>
                <p>The Whistleblowing Helpline for NHS and Social Care (now available through <a href="https://speakup.direct/">Speak Up</a>, delivered by Social Enterprise Direct on behalf of the Department of Health) offers free, independent and confidential advice on <a href="tel:+44800724725">0800 724725</a>.</p>
                <p>The independent whistleblowing charity <a href="https://www.pcaw.org.uk/">Protect- formerly Public Concern at Work</a> can also be contacted for free and confidential advice on <a href="tel:+442074046609">020 7404 6609</a>.</p>

                <h3>Procedure for Disclosure under the Safeguarding Adults (Prevention of Abuse) Policy</h3>
              </header>
                <p>Before reporting an allegation, the person making the disclosure should ensure that they read the <a href="#policySafeguarding">Birtley House Safeguarding Adults Policy</a> and act accordingly.</p>
                <p>If the person making the disclosure has any doubt about whether the Safeguarding Adults Policy is relevant they should act in accordance with the policy and report the disclosure to either the Police or Social Services.</p>
                <p>If they are certain that their disclosure is not covered by the Safeguarding Adults Policy they should report the concern, in confidence, to the Registered Manager, the Board of Directors, or by the previously mentioned methods of disclosure.</p>
                <p>Any person against whom an allegation is made will be informed of his/her rights under employment legislation and internal disciplinary procedures.</p>
                <p>If appropriate, a full investigation will be carried out, as outlined in the <a href="#safe-report">Birtley House Safeguarding Adults Policy</a>, but the person conducting the investigation can refer the disclosure to the Police or Social Services under the Safeguarding Adults Policy at any time if they determine that the alleged incident is covered by the policy.</p>
                <p>If the allegation is of a criminal nature, the Police will be informed. The Police investigation will take priority over any disciplinary or complaints procedure. This is in order to safeguard the integrity of the investigation.</p>
                <p>With regard to abuse, neglect and misconduct within a professional relationship, some perpetrators will be governed by codes of professional conduct and/or employment contracts that will determine the action to be taken against them. Where appropriate, the employee will be reported to the statutory and other bodies responsible for professional regulation.</p>
                <p>An employee may be suspended during the employer’s investigation.  Should this occur they will be kept fully informed of the outcomes.</p>
                <p>Appropriate independent support will be made available to staff who are suspended. Staff also have the right to support from their Trades Union or professional body.</p>
                <p>Support will be given to the staff member who raised the concern.</p>
                <p>Where a case is proved, particularly where this involves professional malpractice, the lead investigator will ensure that the relevant agencies/professional bodies are appropriately informed.</p>
                <p>Staff who do not belong to a regulatory body, and against whom an allegation has been proven, will be disciplined in line with the <a href="https://bhdirectory.github.io/policy/employment-handbook.html#seh-disciplinary">Birtley House Disciplinary Procedure</a>.</p>

The policy is in place to ensure service users and relevant persons are told about any incident where the care or treatment may have gone wrong and appears to have caused significant harm, or has the potential to result in significant harm in the future.</p>

                <p>This policy is written in compliance with the provisions of <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-providers/regulations-enforcement/regulation-20-duty-candour">Regulation 20 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014</a> and its overarching duty.  This legislation was introduced as a direct response to recommendation 181 of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-the-mid-staffordshire-nhs-foundation-trust-public-inquiry">Francis Inquiry Report</a> into Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which recommended that a statutory Duty of Candour be introduced for health and care providers.  This is in addition to the fitness to practice and individual professional standards and requirements for candour expected of staff carrying out regulated activities.</p>

                <h3>The Statutory Duty of Candour</h3>
                  <aside>
                    <p>In interpreting the regulation, the definitions of openness, transparency and candour are taken from the Francis Report:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Openness</strong> – enabling concerns and complaints to be raised freely without fear and questions asked to be answered;</li>
                        <li><strong>Transparency</strong> – allowing information about the truth about performance and outcomes to be shared with staff, patients, the public and regulators;</li>
                        <li><strong>Candour</strong> – any patient harmed by the provision of a healthcare service is informed of the fact and appropriate remedy offered, regardless of whether a complaint has been made or a question asked about it.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </aside>
              </header>
                <h4>What is the Duty of Candour?</h4>
                  <p>The Duty of Candour is a statutory (legal) duty to be open and honest with patients (or ‘service users’), or their families, when something goes wrong that appears to have caused or could lead to significant harm in the future.  It applies to all health and care organisations registered with the regulator, the <a href="https://cqc.org.uk/">Care Quality Commission</a> (CQC).</p>
                  <p>Birtley House recognises the Duty of Candour is underpinned by the following principles:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li><strong>Acknowledgment</li>
                      <li>Truthfulness, timeliness and clarity of communication</li>
                      <li>Apology</li>
                      <li>Recognising patient and carer expectations</li>
                      <li>Professional support</li>
                      <li>Risk management and systems improvement</li>
                      <li>Multidisciplinary responsibility</li>
                      <li>Clinical governance and accountability</li>
                      <li>Confidentiality</li>
                      <li>Continuity of care</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                <h4>Notifiable Safety Incident</h4>
                  <p>Paragraph 9 of <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-providers/regulations-enforcement/regulation-20-duty-candour#guidance">Regulation 20</a> defines what constitutes a notifiable safety incident that triggers the Duty of Candour and the harm thresholds for non-health service providers</p>
                  <p>Any unintended or unexpected incident that occurred in respect of a service user during the provision of a regulated activity that, in the reasonable opinion of a health care professional:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li><strong>Appears to have resulted in:</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>The death of the service user, where this relates directly to the incident, rather than natural cause or illness;</li>
                          <li>Any sensory, motor or intellectual impairment, likely to last for a continuous period of at least 28 days;</li>
                          <li>Structural changes to the service user’s body;</li>
                          <li>Reduction in life expectancy of the service user;</li>
                        </ul> or
                      <li><strong>Requires treatment by a health care professional in order to prevent:</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Death of the service user;</li>
                          <li>Injury to the service user that would, if left untreated, lead to one of the outcomes mentioned above.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                  <p>Appropriate arrangements must be in place to notify a service user and any person acting lawfully on their part where that person lacks the mental capacity to make a decision regarding their care or treatment.  Other than in this situation, information should only be disclosed to family members or carers where the service user has given their express or implied consent.</p>
                  <p>The Regulation does not require any notification when a ‘near miss’ has occurred and the incident has resulted in no harm to that person.  However, there is still an overriding duty to be open and honest.</p>

                    <p>Birtley House fully supports a culture of openness and transparency in all of its dealings with service users and their relatives or representatives.  In this regard, it welcomes the Duty of Candour and embraces the underlying philosophy behind this.  Birtley House believes that being open and promoting a culture of transparency and candour is a prerequisite to providing safe, high quality care. It has a well-developed framework for incident reporting which it expects all staff to comply with and strives to provide the highest standards of care at all times.</p>
                  </aside>
              </header>
                <p>In order to ensure it meets the requirements of Regulation 20 and the overarching duty, in the event of a notifiable incident, Birtley House will:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Develop and maintain its open, transparent and honest culture amongst managers and staff, at all levels and at all times;</li>
                    <li>Provide the necessary staff training to ensure the policy is adhered to;</li>
                    <li>Maintain and review risk management and notification systems improvements;</li>
                    <li>Tell the relevant person, in person, as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware that a notifiable safety incident has occurred, and provide support to them in relation to the incident, including when giving the notification;</li>
                    <li>Conduct a thorough investigation;</li>
                    <li>Provide an account of the incident, which, to the best of the provider’s knowledge, is true of all the facts the body knows about the incident as at the date of the notification;</li>
                    <li>Advise the relevant person what further enquiries the provider believes are appropriate;</li>
                    <li>Offer a sincere and meaningful apology;</li>
                    <li>Follow up the  verbal apology in writing and give a written account of the incident and provide an update on the enquiries made and to be made;</li>
                    <li>Provide support to those involved to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of what happened;</li>
                    <li>Keep a written record of all communication with the relevant person;</li>
                    <li>Maintain a zero tolerance approach to bullying and harassment, including in relation to duty of candour. In any instance where it is alleged that a member of staff may have obstructed another in exercising their duty of candour, an investigation will be carried out. Furthermore, if a professionally registered member of staff is found, following investigation, to have breached their duty of candour, referral to the relevant professional body may be indicated.</li>
