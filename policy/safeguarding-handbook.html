          <h2>Deprivation of Liberty Policy</h2>
            <aside>
              <p>From 1 April 2009 any care home or hospital treating or caring for a person in such a way that they are depriving that person of their liberty is required to seek authority to do so.  This document has been written to explain the process that must be followed in order to obtain authorisation if there is not already authority given by the court.</p>

                <h3>Scope</h3>
              </header>
                <p>This policy is written in accordance with the regulatory framework provided by the Mental Capacity Act 2005, the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Code of Practice 2009 and the Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice.  This policy should be read with the Mental Capacity Policy.</p>
                <p>n particular, this policy aims to ensure the Five Statutory Principles are properly implemented:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established they lack capacity.</li>
                    <li>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help them to do so have been taken without success.</li>
                    <li>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision.</li>
                    <li>An act done or decision made, under the Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or made in, the person’s best interests.</li>
                    <li>Before the act is done, or the decision is made, regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person’s rights and freedom of action.</li>
                  </ol>

                <p>Through staff training, pre-admission assessment, ongoing assessment and input from all concerned parties, every effort will be made by this organisation to comply with the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) Code of Practice.</p>

              </header>
                  <p>In a registered care home the “Managing Authority” is the person registered under part 2 of the Care Standards Act 2000. In the case of this organisation the “Managing Authority” is the home manager. The Home Manager is responsible for all aspects of procedure relating to the Deprivation of Liberty of Relevant Person/s.</p>
                  <p>The Supervisory Body will be the local social services authority (LSSA) arranging, paying for, or contributing to the Relevant Person’s care. If the person is self-funding or financed under continuing care or was of no fixed abode before admission or the home manager cannot ascertain where they normally lived, application for authorisation will be sent to the local authority in which the home is located.</p>

              </header>
                <p>The Home Manager is responsible for ensuring all staff have a clear understanding of the Mental Capacity Act and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards. Staff will be trained on how to assess capacity and make a decision in a person’s best interests, also, what the act says about the use of restraint.</p>
                <p>Staff will be made aware of what it means when a Relevant Person has been authorised for Deprivation of Liberty.</p>
                <p>Staff will receive training on induction and further training to ensure they are updated on developments in relation to DoLS.</p>
                <p>The Home Manager will ensure that staff can access advice and information about the Mental Capacity Act and the deprivation of liberty safeguards.</p>

          <h2>Data Security Policy</h2>
            <aside>
              <p>Article 5(1)(f) of the <i>General Data Protection Regulation</i> (GDPR) concerns the ‘integrity and confidentiality’ of personal data. It says that personal data shall be:</p>
                <blockquote>Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures</blockquote>
              <p>Our Data Security Policy sets out procedures that ensure:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the safekeeping of all records from their creation to disposal;</li>
                  <li>the safe sharing of information externally when there is a legal basis to do so;</li>
                  <li>personal information is protected and that it is not disclosed inappropriately, either by accident or design, whilst in use or when it is being transferred;</li>
                  <li>all records are retained and destroyed in-line with the <a href="#rm-retentionAndDisposal">Retention & Disposal Procedures</a>.</li>
                  <li>preserve the confidentiality and accuracy of all electronic assets;</li>
                  <li>protect those assets against unauthorised disclosure.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </aside>

              <header>
                <h3>Access to Records</h3>
                  <aside>
                    <p>Caldicott Principle No. 4 states:</p>
                      <blockquote>Only those individuals who need access to personal confidential data should have access to it, and they should only have access to the data items that they need to see.  This may mean introducing access controls or splitting data flows where one data flow is used for several purposes.</blockquote>
                  </aside>
              </header>
                    <p>Physical access to records shall only be granted on a strict ‘need to know’ basis.  Access to electronic records shall be granted using the principle that every program and every user of the system should operate using the least set of privileges necessary to complete their job.</p>
                    <p>During their induction each staff member who requires access to confidential information for their job role will be trained on the safe handling of all information and will be taught the procedures which govern how data is used, stored, shared and organised in our organisation.</p>
                    <p>Staff must retain personal and confidential information and data securely in locked storage when not in use, and keys should not be left in the barrels of filing cabinets and doors.</p>

                <h3>Methods of Sharing Confidential Information</h3>
                  <aside>
                    <p>Caldicott Principle No. 7 states:</p>
                      <blockquote>Health and social care professionals should have the confidence to share information in the best interests of their patients within the framework set out by these principles.  They should be supported by the policies of their employers, regulators and professional bodies.</blockquote>
                    <p>We ensure that there are secure points for the receipt of personal information transferred to us and we have applied the following measures to safeguard personal information during receipt and transfer/transit.</p>
                  </aside>
              </header>
                  <h4>Written & Verbal Communication</h4>
                    <p>Staff members have been provided with training in relation to data protection. They know that they must take appropriate precautions not to reveal confidential information e.g. to avoid being overheard when making a phone call or not to have confidential conversations in public places or open offices. The <i>Employee Handbook</i> and training informs them that breach of this procedure may be a disciplinary or legal offense (see our <a href="#confidentialityCode">Confidentiality Code of Conduct</a>).</p>

                  <h4 id="post">Postal Services and Couriers</h4>
                    <p>We will ensure that all confidential information that we transfer by post or courier is done so as securely as is practicable. All records transferred in this manner are addressed to a named individual and marked “Private and Confidential”. All records which are posted will be done through signed-for delivery so that it is guaranteed that the correct person receives the record.</p>

                  <h4 id="faxes">Faxes</h4>
                    <p>The fax machine is located in the Admin Office.  To ensure that confidential information transferred by fax is done so as securely as is practicable, we ensure that:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>the fax number is always double checked, and frequently used numbers are stored in the fax machine to reduce the risk of typing errors;</li>
                        <li>a fax cover sheet is used and marked "Private and Confidential";</li>
                        <li>faxes are only sent to a named person rather than a team;</li>
                        <li>the recipient is informed that a fax will be sent, and asked to confirm receipt;</li>
                        <li>faxes are not sent outside a recipient organisation's working hours where there is no-one present to receive;</li>
                        <li>we regularly check the date and time, especially following power outages, or change of British summer time;</li>
                        <li>logs are retained in line with our retention schedule;</li>
                      </ul>
                    <p>For improved data security, the use of faxes will be replaced by encrypted email (see <a href="#email">Email</a>).</p>

                  <h4 id="email">Email</h4>
                    <p>The Company does not currently have access to secure email, until such time, the procedure is to never send or receive sensitive personal information via email.</p>
                    <p>It is the intention of the Company to apply for access to the <i>NHSMail</i> system which will allow secure transfer of information via this medium.  The policy will be updated once this is in place</p>
                    <p>Before sending any email containing confidential information:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>consider whether this is the most appropriate form of distribution;</li>
                        <li>check the content for accuracy and to ensure it is up-to-date and relevant;</li>
                        <li>check recipient address(es) for accuracy to ensure that the email is not sent to the wrong person;</li>
                        <li>consider whether any recipients on the distribution list may not expect their email addresses to be shared with others;</li>
                        <li>consider encrypting any attachments where resources of both sender and receiver allow;</li>
                        <li>ensure that you use the email signature that has been provided and approved by the Company, including the Company’s legal disclaimer for emails.</li>
                      </ul>
                    <p>Whilst the Company takes strict measures to prevent incoming ‘spam’ emails, it is inevitable that some will find their way to inboxes. Unsolicited emails from unknown sources should be treated with suspicion. In such emails, never click any links nor open attachments. If you have an unusually high number of such emails, please contact the <i>IG Lead</i>.</p>
                    <p>Just as the use of the postal address of the Company should not be used for personal deliveries, so a Company email address should not be used to receive personal emails. However, if an email of a non-work-related nature is received, on no account should the email be forwarded to others.  The use of a company email address to register for any personal online account or nonbusiness-related services is also forbidden.</p>

                  <h4>Web-based Upload</h4>
                    <p>Use of cloud-based software.  Specific guidance is provided by the software provider and training will be given as necessary.  Examples currently in use include:</p>
                      <ul>

                  <h3>Card Payments (PCI DSS Compliance)</h3>
                    <aside>
                      <p>Compliance with <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</a> (PCI DSS) is mandatory for any company that stores, processes, or transmits payment cardholder data.  The Company does not store or transmit payment card data but does process card payments which are subsequently handled by an external service provider who is certified as being <i>PCI DSS</i> compliant.</p>
                    </aside>
                </header>
                  <h4>Arrangements</h4>
                    <p>A <i>Cardholder Data Environment</i> (CDE) has been defined.  The storage, operation and  maintenance of any equipment used to process card payments is restricted to this area only.  The processing of card payments is only done by authorised employees who have had specific instruction in this regard.  A register of these employees is maintained.</p>

                  <h4>Responsibilities</h4>
                      <ul>

                        <li>The policy will be reviewed annually by the <i>IG Lead</i> and updated where necessary to reflect changes to business objectives, risk environment, systems, authorised personnel or the business’s merchant level;</li>
                        <li>The <i>IG Lead</i> will also complete the mandatory <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org">annual self-assessment questionnaire</a> (SAQ), issued by the PCI Security Standards Council, to demonstrate compliance.</li>
                      </ul>

                        <li>The card payment device or any other technologies are not to be used for any purpose other than official business;</li>
                        <li>No sensitive data relating to card payments is to be stored on computers.  If it is necessary to physically record the cardholder’s name, Primary Account Number(PAN), the expiry date of the card or service code, this must be done so on paper and must be kept locked away and shredded at the first convenient opportunity;</li>
                        <li>The Card Verification Number should not be physically recorded under any circumstances;</li>
                        <li>All merchant copies of receipts must have the PAN masked;</li>
                        <li>All sensitive data is shredded either directly or using the locked confidential waste bins;</li>
                        <li>Privately-owned computers and other equipment (including mobile telephones, laptop computers and tablets) must not be used for the processing, storage or transmission of any cardholder data associated with any aspect of the business;</li>
                        <li>There must be no distribution of any media used to record cardholder data outside of the <i>CDE</i>;</li>
                        <li>Cameras, mobile telephones (incorporating cameras) and visual, and audio recording devices must not be used in the <i>CDE</i>.</li>
                      </ol>

                    <h4>Permissions and Systems Maintenance</h4>
                      <p>The <i>IG Lead</i> must be informed and grant permission in any of the following instances:</p>

                </header>
                    <p>All staff must follow the retention schedule for records in our organisation. At the end of their lifespan, the records will go through an appraisal process. This process will determine if there is a continuing legal basis for keeping the record. The <i>IG Lead</i> will have final responsibility for determining whether the record will be destroyed or retained. They will maintain a record of all retention or disposal decisions.</p>
                    <p>The Company will adhere to the retention timelines determined by the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/looking-after-information/data-security-and-information-governance/information-governance-alliance-iga">Information Governance Alliance</a> (IGA) in <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/article/1202/Records-Management-Code-of-Practice-for-Health-and-Social-Care-2016">Appendix 3 of Records Management Code of Practise for Health and Social Care 2016</a>.</p>

              <h3>Network Access Control</h3>
            </header>
                <p>In order to gain access to the network, <i>Registered Users</i> will be authenticated by a secure log-on credentials, designed to minimise the opportunity for unauthorised access.  Remote access to the network is strictly limited to essential users and administrators only and is also password protected.<p>
                <p>The Company encourages password management procedures following guidance on the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-security/policy-and-good-practice-in-health-care/passwords/example-policy">NHS Digital website</a> and the <a href=" https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/password-guidance-simplifying-your-approach">National Cyber Security Centre</a>.</p>
                <p>Where software and systems allow, the Company will ensure that each user is identified by a unique user ID so that users can be linked to and be accountable for their actions.  A record is kept of all users given access to the Company Network and its system.</p>
                <p>The use of group IDs is only permitted where they are suitable for the work carried out (such as in the case of departmental email accounts).</p>

                <p>The <i>IG Lead</i> will ensure that:
                  <ul>
                    <li>all users of the network are provided with the necessary security guidance, awareness and where appropriate training to discharge their security responsibilities;</li>
                    <li>access rights to the network will be allocated on the requirements of the user's job, rather than on a status basis.</li>
                    <li>only <i>Registered Users</i> are able to access the network and are de-registered when access is no longer required;</li>
                    <li>user access rights will be immediately removed or reviewed for those users who have left the Company or if their role changes.</li>
                    <li>security privileges (i.e. "superuser" or network administrator rights) to the network will be allocated on the requirements of the user's job, rather than on a status basis.</li>
                    <li>good password management practices are followed;</li>
                    <li>other than through a formal contract with a company providing IT support, all third-party access to the network is only granted in exceptional circumstances in order to provide a beneficial service.</li>
                    <li>there is a regular review of all access rights, at least once a year. The review is designed to positively confirm all system users. Any lapsed or unwanted logons which are identified are disabled immediately and deleted unless positively reconfirmed.</li>

                      <p>You will come into contact with your colleagues' personal information on a frequent basis and we all have a responsibility to ensure that we do not abuse our privileges. In order to manage this risk, all staff are given training in the principles of data protection and the Company has published an Information Governance Handbook which includes policies relating to the safeguarding of all personal information, whether such data belongs to our residents, visitors or staff themselves. Where we hold personal information about you, it is done so to the same standard as that of our residents. Where third-party service providers and other businesses are contracted to work with us, their contractual terms require the same standards of confidentiality as your own.</p>
                      <p>Your personal information will never be sold and is never shared unnecessarily with third-parties. It would only be disclosed outside of the business with your consent or if we are obliged to do so by law enforcement agencies or in the public interest. Examples of third-parties with whom we may occasionally share your personal information include: CQC, Home Office, UKVI, HMRC & HSE.</p>
                      <p>Your personal information, as standard, will be held by us for a period of 6 years following the end of your employment after which it will be securely destroyed or rendered non-identifiable. Any remaining information is held beyond this date for the historical record of the Company. Further details of our Document Retention Schedule is available as part of the Information Governance Handbook.</p>
                      <p>You are legally entitled to see copies of all personal information that we hold about you and to ask for any errors to be be corrected. In certain circumstances you may be able to have your personal information permanently erased, or its' processing restricted. This would be done through a process known as a Subject Access Request, details of which are explained in <a href="#subjectAccessRequests">Subject Access Requests (SAR): A Guide</a>.</p>

                      <h4>Submit your request</h4>
                        <p>In order to make a <i>Subject Access Request</i>, you (or in some cases your legal representative), should contact the <i>IG Lead</i>.</p>
                      <h4>ID checks</h4>
                        <p>In order to process a <i>Subject Access Request</i> we will use reasonable means to verify the identity of the individual making the request.</p>
                      <h4>Receiving your information</h4>
                        We will provide a copy of any information which it is lawful to provide free of charge. If further copies are required, we will charge a fee which will exclusively cover the administration costs of making copies.  We will provide copies of the information requested in an appropriate format.</p>
                      <h4>Meeting your expectations</h4>
                        <p>The <i>IG Lead</i> will maintain a record of any requests you make in regards to your rights and the outcome of such requests</p>

                        <p>We would not usually charge a fee to comply with a request, however, if any request is manifestly unfounded or excessive we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee or to refuse to uphold your request.</p>
                        <p>If we refuse to uphold a request we will explain why in writing and you will be informed of your legal rights to complain to the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/">Information Commissioners Office</a> (https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/) and to seek a judicial remedy.</p>
                        <p>If applicable, where we may have appropriately shared that individual’s records with a third-party we will inform this third-party of the request if appropriate.</p>
                      <h4>Records of the deceased</h4>
                        <p>Confidential records of the deceased have the rights afford to them by the Duty of Confidentiality. Should any person wish to request access for any records of the deceased they should contact the <i>IG Lead</i>;</p>

                    <h3>Electronic Communications - Acceptable Use Policy</h3>
                  </header>
                    <h4>Scope</h4>
                      <p>This policy covers the use of all forms of electronic communication including email, fax or telephone calls, social media, SMS (text messaging) or any form of voice or video transmissions either live or recorded.</p>
                    <h4>Etiquette</h4>
                      <p>employees should consider all communications made from Company assets or using Company networks, including anything uploaded to the internet which makes reference to Company business, as Company property.</p>
                      <p>Electronic communication should not be used as a substitute for face to face or telephone conversations or meetings.</p>
                      <p>All electronic communications should be clear and unambiguous and used primarily to distribute/update information, confirm arrangements, confirm meetings etc.</p>
                      <p>It must not be used for purposes outside of the job role or for any personal reasons.</p>
                      <p>Email should be treated as if it were a hard copy letter and drafted and checked in the same way. The Company will value an email message the same as a hard copy letter.</p>
                      <p>All communications must adhere to the principles set out in the Company’s <a href="#policyDataProtection">Data Protection Policy</a>. Where confidential information is being sent, either directly or via attachments in email or hyperlinks, appropriate controls must be used to ensure that this information is not at risk of a breach.</p>
                      <p>The same standards of behaviour are expected in electronic communication as apply to verbal communication in the workplace.  No email message or response to an email should be sent in haste, anger or hostility. Ideally a time for consideration should elapse between drafting and sending a reply. Email messages should be checked after drafting for clarity, accuracy of message and absence of words which could be abusive, emotive, etc. The language used must be consistent with conventional standards, decency and respect for others and good manners.  Commenting on or about another person should be avoided but, if it is unavoidable, should only be based on and backed up by facts. On no account must any Company communication system or any social media platform be used for vindictive, harassing, discriminatory or abusive comment or criticism of anyone, whether this is to target the Company, another employee or any third-party. Furthermore, it may not be used for electronic stalking.  Words in capital letters could be considered shouting. The use of exclamation marks, humour and sarcasm can be especially problematic in emails and should be used with caution. Please consider the ‘tone’ of your message in the same way you would speak to someone face to face.
                      </p>
                      <p>employees using any public digital platform outside of work must ensure that they do not make any reference to the Home by name or in photographs, or to any employee, resident or any other person connected with the company other than in an entirely positive manner.</p>
                    <h4>Disciplinary Action</h4>
                      <p>Company websites and social media sites are the sole property of the Company and any unauthorised interference with or copying and variation of such websites is not only gross misconduct but also can generate an action for damages.  A person receiving an email which they feel contravenes these rules should notify their line manager immediately. On no account should such concerns, which may become subject to an investigation, be discussed with other employees as this would be viewed as gossip and subject to the relevant policy and disciplinary action.  Any person proved to have deliberately used email in a way that contravenes the policy will be deemed guilty of gross misconduct and will be subject to disciplinary procedures.  Failure to comply with any aspect of this policy will be treated as a serious breach of the rules and will result in disciplinary action.</p>
