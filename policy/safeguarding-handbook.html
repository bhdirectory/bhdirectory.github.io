          <h2>Deprivation of Liberty Policy</h2>
            <aside>
              <p>From 1 April 2009 any care home or hospital treating or caring for a person in such a way that they are depriving that person of their liberty is required to seek authority to do so.  This document has been written to explain the process that must be followed in order to obtain authorisation if there is not already authority given by the court.</p>

                <h3>Scope</h3>
              </header>
                <p>This policy is written in accordance with the regulatory framework provided by the Mental Capacity Act 2005, the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Code of Practice 2009 and the Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice.  This policy should be read with the Mental Capacity Policy.</p>
                <p>n particular, this policy aims to ensure the Five Statutory Principles are properly implemented:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established they lack capacity.</li>
                    <li>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help them to do so have been taken without success.</li>
                    <li>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision.</li>
                    <li>An act done or decision made, under the Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or made in, the person’s best interests.</li>
                    <li>Before the act is done, or the decision is made, regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person’s rights and freedom of action.</li>
                  </ol>

              </header>
                <p>Through staff training, pre-admission assessment, ongoing assessment and input from all concerned parties, every effort will be made by this organisation to comply with the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) Code of Practice.</p>

              </header>
                  <p>In a registered care home the “Managing Authority” is the person registered under part 2 of the Care Standards Act 2000. In the case of this organisation the “Managing Authority” is the home manager. The Home Manager is responsible for all aspects of procedure relating to the Deprivation of Liberty of Relevant Person/s.</p>
                  <p>The Supervisory Body will be the local social services authority (LSSA) arranging, paying for, or contributing to the Relevant Person’s care. If the person is self-funding or financed under continuing care or was of no fixed abode before admission or the home manager cannot ascertain where they normally lived, application for authorisation will be sent to the local authority in which the home is located.</p>

              </header>
                <p>The Home Manager is responsible for ensuring all staff have a clear understanding of the Mental Capacity Act and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards. Staff will be trained on how to assess capacity and make a decision in a person’s best interests, also, what the act says about the use of restraint.</p>
                <p>Staff will be made aware of what it means when a Relevant Person has been authorised for Deprivation of Liberty.</p>
                <p>Staff will receive training on induction and further training to ensure they are updated on developments in relation to DoLS.</p>
                <p>The Home Manager will ensure that staff can access advice and information about the Mental Capacity Act and the deprivation of liberty safeguards.</p>

              <header>
                <h3>Admission</h3>
                  <aside>
                    <p>When a Relevant Person is referred to the home, the Home Manager will ensure that the referrer identifies any possibility that there may be a need for a deprivation of liberty authorisation. This authorisation should be applied for 28 days before the deprivation of liberty is due to start.  In the case of an admission from the social service or NHS, they will normally inform you well before admission, however, when family arranges a placement or others it is likely that the Home Manager will need to raise the issue.</p>
                  </aside>
              </header>
                    <p>The Home Manager will ensure that the potential Relevant Person has their mental capacity to agree to residing at the home assessed. If they lack capacity to consent to the admission then the Home Manager will require the referrer to supply information about the following:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Does the Relevant Person have anyone with Lasting Power of Attorney?</li>
                        <li>If so, is the LPA for Health and Personal Welfare issues?</li>
                        <li>Does the person have a deputy appointed by the Court of Protection?</li>
                        <li>If so, is the Deputy empowered for Health and Personal Welfare issues?</li>
                        <li>Has the person made any Advance Decisions to Refuse Medical Treatment, which apply to anything, which may happen while they are in the home?</li>
                        <li>Does the referrer know of any wishes and feelings expressed by the Relevant Person, which relate to their care? (These are sometimes called advance statements).</li>
                        <li>Do they have a list of people who should be consulted when a major decision is being made?</li>
                      </ol>
              <footer>
                <p>If it is determined that the pre-admission assessment does not indicate a deprivation of liberty authorisation is necessary but circumstances change on admission then the Home Manager will follow the urgent authorisation procedure.</p>
              </footer>

                <h3>Identifying if authorisation is needed</h3>
                  <aside>
                    <p>The Home Manager will ensure that all residents are assessed for a need for authorisation. This will normally be pre-admission but on occasions will be post-admission.  Sometimes a person will be admitted with no need for authorisation but because of changes in their condition the need develops over time. The home’s ongoing assessments will recognise this before deprivation is actually necessary and the Home Manager will apply to the supervisory body for authorisation.</p>
                  </aside>
              </header>
                  <h4>Determining a Deprivation of Liberty</h4>
                    <p>The basis for determining whether a person is deprived of liberty is subject to an evolving legal position.  The starting point should be the specific facts of the Relevant Person’s situation.  A range of factors should be considered, including the type, duration, manner and implementation of the measure in question.  Whether there has been a deprivation of liberty will then be a question of degree and intensity.  The “Acid Test” set out by the Supreme Court in Cheshire West, when assessing if the Relevant Person is deprived of liberty, is whether that person is:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Under continuous or complete supervision and control;</li>
                        <li>Not free to leave;</li>
                        <li>Lacks capacity to consent to these arrangements.</li>
                      </ol>

                  <h4>Urgent Life-saving Medical Treatment</h4>
                    <p>This policy also takes in to consideration the recent guidance resulting from the Ferreira court of appeal judgement, of which staff will be made aware.  In light of this guidance, authorisation will not be sought for depriving the Relevant Person of their liberty where the need to do so arises in the context of urgent life-saving medical treatment, in accordance with regulation 17 Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  Such circumstances would arise where:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>The relevant Person lacked capacity to make decisions about their own care as a consequence of their physical health condition (for example, they are unconscious);</li><br /><strong>AND</strong><br />
                        <li>The patient would have been treated the same way irrespective of whether they had the capacity to make their own decisions when conscious; </li><br /><strong>AND</strong><br />
                        <li>If the patient were conscious and chose to leave, they would not be prevented from doing so.</li>
                      </ol>

                  <h4>Indicators of a potential Deprivation of Liberty</h4>
                    <p>If the Home Manager believes that the arrangements for care MIGHT represent deprivation of liberty, they must apply for authorisation.</p>
                    <p>Points, which MIGHT indicate Deprivation of Liberty, include:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>•	Restraint or sedation on admission where the resident resists.</li>
                        <li>Complete and effective control over care and movement of the person.</li>
                        <li>Control over assessments, treatment, contacts and residence.</li>
                        <li>A decision has been made that the person will not be released to the care of others, or permitted to live elsewhere, unless the staff consider it appropriate.</li>
                        <li>There has been a refusal to let the person live with a relative.</li>
                        <li>The person’s social contacts are determined for them, e.g. they are not allowed contact with particular people including relatives.</li>
                        <li>Ongoing restraint or sedation required.</li>
                        <li>The person receives sedative medication for which they do not have capacity to consent.</li>
                        <li>The person is restricted to a small part of the home.</li>
                        <li>The person receives high level of observation.</li>
                        <li>The person seems to be trying to leave.</li>

                  <h3>Best Interests Decisions</h3>
                    <aside>
                      <p>The balance of these issues and others will determine deprivation of liberty.  If none of these apply, then it is unlikely that there is a deprivation of liberty. It is a requirement that where a deprivation of liberty is authorised it must be the least restrictive option that is proportionate to the need to prevent harm and is in the Relevant Person’s best interest.</p>

                </header>
                      <p>The best interests of a person subject to a deprivation of liberty will be considered in accordance with the Code of Practice and the following guidelines:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>All relevant circumstances should be taken in to account.</li>
                          <li>Decisions should not be made on the basis of a person’s age or appearance alone, as this may lead to unjustified assumptions.</li>
                          <li>If there is a chance that the person will have capacity in the future, the decision should, if at all possible, be delayed until they do.</li>
                          <li>The person should be encouraged and helped to join in making the decision when possible.</li>
                          <li>If the decision is about life sustaining medical treatment, it must not be motivated by a wish to hasten a person’s death.</li>
                          <li>The person’s past and present wishes, feelings, beliefs and values must be considered.</li>
                          <li>The views of other relevant people should be considered, in particular:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Anyone the person has asked to be consulted.</li>
                              <li>Those involved in caring for the person.</li>
                              <li>Anyone else interested in their welfare.</li>

                              <li>Any court appointed deputy.</li>
                              <li>There should be no discrimination.</li>

                <footer>
                  <p>It is not uncommon for friends and family to have different views about the treatment or care of a loved one.  Disputes may be resolved through getting a second opinion, mediation or referring to the Court of Protection for a ruling.</p>

Examples of personal information we hold about you on a temporary basis include: records relating to the use of our IT networks & CCTV records and telephone voice messages.</p>
                      <p>As part of your employment record, we may well have personal information that is considered 'sensitive'. Where this information is held, it is only done so in order to fulfill the contractual and legal obligations of the business and will be treated with the strictest confidence. A very limited number of staff have access to the sensitive personal information of other employees and access to such information has additional control measures in place. Examples of sensitive personal information we hold about you on a permanent basis include: health records; DBS records, accident records & sensitive employment records.</p>
                      <p>You will come into contact with your colleagues' personal information on a frequent basis and we all have a responsibility to ensure that we do not abuse our privileges. In order to manage this risk, all staff are given training in the principles of data protection and the Company has published an Information Governance Handbook which includes policies relating to the safeguarding of all personal information, whether such data belongs to our residents, visitors or staff themselves. Where we hold personal information about you, it is done so to the same standard as that of our residents. Where third-party service providers and other businesses are contracted to work with us, their contractual terms require the same standards of confidentiality as your own.</p>
                      <p>Your personal information will never be sold and is never shared unnecessarily with third-parties. It would only be disclosed outside of the business with your consent or if we are obliged to do so by law enforcement agencies or in the public interest. Examples of third-parties with whom we may occasionally share your personal information include: CQC, Home Office, UKVI, HMRC & HSE.</p>
                      <p>Your personal information, as standard, will be held by us for a period of 6 years following the end of your employment after which it will be securely destroyed or rendered non-identifiable. Any remaining information is held beyond this date for the historical record of the Company. Further details of our Document Retention Schedule is available as part of the Information Governance Handbook.</p>
                      <p>You are legally entitled to see copies of all personal information that we hold about you and to ask for any errors to be be corrected. In certain circumstances you may be able to have your personal information permanently erased, or its' processing restricted. This would be done through a process known as a Subject Access Request, details of which are explained in <a href="#subjectAccessRequests">Subject Access Requests (SAR): A Guide</a>.</p>

                      <h4>Submit your request</h4>
                        <p>In order to make a <i>Subject Access Request</i>, you (or in some cases your legal representative), should contact the <i>IG Lead</i>.</p>
                      <h4>ID checks</h4>
                        <p>In order to process a <i>Subject Access Request</i> we will use reasonable means to verify the identity of the individual making the request.</p>
                      <h4>Receiving your information</h4>
                        We will provide a copy of any information which it is lawful to provide free of charge. If further copies are required, we will charge a fee which will exclusively cover the administration costs of making copies.  We will provide copies of the information requested in an appropriate format.</p>
                      <h4>Meeting your expectations</h4>

                        <p>We would not usually charge a fee to comply with a request, however, if any request is manifestly unfounded or excessive we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee or to refuse to uphold your request.</p>

                        <p>If applicable, where we may have appropriately shared that individual’s records with a third-party we will inform this third-party of the request if appropriate.</p>

                        <p>Confidential records of the deceased have the rights afford to them by the Duty of Confidentiality. Should any person wish to request access for any records of the deceased they should contact the <i>IG Lead</i>;</p>

                    <h3>Electronic Communications - Acceptable Use Policy</h3>
                  </header>
                    <h4>Scope</h4>
                      <p>This policy covers the use of all forms of electronic communication including email, fax or telephone calls, social media, SMS (text messaging) or any form of voice or video transmissions either live or recorded.</p>
                    <h4>Etiquette</h4>
                      <p>employees should consider all communications made from Company assets or using Company networks, including anything uploaded to the internet which makes reference to Company business, as Company property.</p>
                      <p>Electronic communication should not be used as a substitute for face to face or telephone conversations or meetings.</p>
                      <p>All electronic communications should be clear and unambiguous and used primarily to distribute/update information, confirm arrangements, confirm meetings etc.</p>
                      <p>It must not be used for purposes outside of the job role or for any personal reasons.</p>
                      <p>Email should be treated as if it were a hard copy letter and drafted and checked in the same way. The Company will value an email message the same as a hard copy letter.</p>
                      <p>All communications must adhere to the principles set out in the Company’s <a href="#policyDataProtection">Data Protection Policy</a>. Where confidential information is being sent, either directly or via attachments in email or hyperlinks, appropriate controls must be used to ensure that this information is not at risk of a breach.</p>
                      <p>The same standards of behaviour are expected in electronic communication as apply to verbal communication in the workplace.  No email message or response to an email should be sent in haste, anger or hostility. Ideally a time for consideration should elapse between drafting and sending a reply. Email messages should be checked after drafting for clarity, accuracy of message and absence of words which could be abusive, emotive, etc. The language used must be consistent with conventional standards, decency and respect for others and good manners.  Commenting on or about another person should be avoided but, if it is unavoidable, should only be based on and backed up by facts. On no account must any Company communication system or any social media platform be used for vindictive, harassing, discriminatory or abusive comment or criticism of anyone, whether this is to target the Company, another employee or any third-party. Furthermore, it may not be used for electronic stalking.  Words in capital letters could be considered shouting. The use of exclamation marks, humour and sarcasm can be especially problematic in emails and should be used with caution. Please consider the ‘tone’ of your message in the same way you would speak to someone face to face.
                      </p>
                      <p>employees using any public digital platform outside of work must ensure that they do not make any reference to the Home by name or in photographs, or to any employee, resident or any other person connected with the company other than in an entirely positive manner.</p>
                    <h4>Disciplinary Action</h4>
                      <p>Company websites and social media sites are the sole property of the Company and any unauthorised interference with or copying and variation of such websites is not only gross misconduct but also can generate an action for damages.  A person receiving an email which they feel contravenes these rules should notify their line manager immediately. On no account should such concerns, which may become subject to an investigation, be discussed with other employees as this would be viewed as gossip and subject to the relevant policy and disciplinary action.  Any person proved to have deliberately used email in a way that contravenes the policy will be deemed guilty of gross misconduct and will be subject to disciplinary procedures.  Failure to comply with any aspect of this policy will be treated as a serious breach of the rules and will result in disciplinary action.</p>
