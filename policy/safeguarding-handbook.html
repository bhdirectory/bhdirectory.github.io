        <h2>Safeguarding Adults (Prevention of Abuse) Policy</h2>
          <aside>
            <p>This policy has been drafted with reference to <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/contents/enacted">The Care Act 2014</a>, <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/9/part/5/enacted">Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 (Part 5)</a>, <a href="https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/social-care-and-health/care-and-support-for-adults/contact#concerns">Surrey Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH)</a>, <a href="http://www.surreysab.org.uk/#">Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board (SSAB)</a>, <a href="https://www.adass.org.uk/safeguarding-policy-page">The Association of Directors of Social Services (ADASS)</a> and the Deaprtment of Health and Social Care's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/care-act-statutory-guidance/care-and-support-statutory-guidance#safeguarding-1">Care and Support Statutory Guidance</a>.</p>
            <p>Birtley House recognises the six guiding principles of safeguarding:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Empowerment – residents are supported in making their own decisions and choices with informed consent.</li>
                <li>Protection – information, support and representation are provided for those in need of it.</li>
                <li>Prevention – action should be taken before harm occurs.</li>
                <li>Proportionate response – proportionality and consideration of human rights must be used in response to any risk or occurrence of abuse.</li>
                <li>Partnership and community response.</li>
                <li>Accountability and transparency.</li>

              <h3>Safeguarding Policy Statement</h3>
            </header>
                <p>At Birtley House we expect our residents to live in an environment that is safe, supportive and free from abuse. Each will be able to participate in the life of the Home, without fear of any kind of abusive behaviour being directed towards them. All persons living or being cared for, working at, or visiting this home will be treated with respect for their individuality and human rights. Each person will, therefore, conduct him or her self in such a way that they can cause no offence to any other.</p>
                <p>A culture of zero tolerance towards abuse will be maintained and the Managers will ensure that staff concerns are dealt with confidentially, thoroughly and fairly. Any abuse of power or privilege, whether perpetrated by staff, visitors or residents, will be dealt with promptly.</p>
                <p>Abuse takes many different forms, and occurs in all cultures, all religions and all social classes.  This policy is a guidance document for staff to ensure they are aware of the various types of abuse, to enable them to recognise the signs that abuse may be occurring and outlines the actions they should take if they suspect that abuse has occurred or may occur.</p>
                <p>The organisation is committed to the aims of adult safeguarding:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>prevent harm and reduce the risk of abuse or neglect to adults with care and support needs;</li>
                    <li>stop abuse or neglect wherever possible;</li>
                    <li>safeguard  adults  in  a  way  that  supports them  in  making  choices  and  having  control about how they want to live;</li>
                    <li>promote an approach that concentrates on improving life for the adults concerned;</li>
                    <li>raise public awareness so that communities as a whole, alongside professionals, play their part in preventing, identifying and responding to abuse and neglect;</li>
                    <li>provide  information  and  support  in  accessible  ways  to  help  people  understand  the different types of abuse, how to stay safe and what to do to raise a concern about the safety or well-being of an adult;</li>
                    <li>address what has caused the abuse or neglect.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>To contribute to meeting these aims, we will:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Manage our services in a way which minimises the risk of abuse occurring;</li>
                    <li>Work with adults with care and support needs and other agencies to end any abuse that is taking place.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>To achieve these aims we will:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Ensure that all managers, employees and volunteers have access to and are familiar with this safeguarding adult policy and procedure and their responsibilities within it;</li>
                    <li>Ensure concerns or allegations of abuse are always taken seriously;</li>
                    <li>Ensure the Mental Capacity Act is used to make decisions on behalf of those adults at risk who are unable to make particular decisions forthemselves;</li>
                    <li>Ensure  all  staff  receive  training  in  relation  safeguarding  adults  at  a  level  relevant  to their role;</li>
                    <li>Ensure  that  people  using  our  services,  and  where  relevant  their  relatives  and  their friends,  have  access  to  information  about  how  to  report concerns  or  allegations  of abuse;</li>
                    <li>Ensure there is a named lead person to promote adult safeguarding awareness and practice within the organisation This policy and procedure has been developed to be consistent with the <a href="http://www.surreysab.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SSAB-Policy-and-Procedure-2018-FINAL-v2.0-agreed-on-240518-updated-07.08.18.pdf">Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board Adult Safeguarding Policy and Procedures</a>.</li>

              <h3>The Definition of Abuse</h3>
                <aside>
                  <blockquote>Abuse is a violation of an individual’s human and civil right by any other person or persons.</blockquote>
                  <p>Incidents of abuse may be multiple, either to one person in a continuing relationship or service context or to more than one person at a time. Some instances of abuse will constitute a criminal offence.  Criminal charges can be brought against the abuser under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. In addition, statutory offences have been created which specifically protect those who may be incapacitated in various ways. Examples of actions which may constitute criminal offences are assault, whether physical or psychological, sexual assault and rape, theft, fraud, or other forms of exploitation, and certain forms of discrimination, whether on basis of race or gender.</p>
                  <p>Registered Nurses are bound by the NMC Code of Professional Conduct; standards for conduct, performance and ethics (2018), which states that they are responsible for ensuring that they safeguard the interests of their patients at all times.</p>
                </aside>
            </header>
              <p>The currently recognised forms of abuse have been broadly defined under the following categories:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Physical Abuse</strong> – <i>The non accidental infliction of physical force that results (or could result) in bodily injury pain or impairment.</i><br />Examples of behaviour: hitting, slapping, pushing, burning, physical restraint, harassment, enforced sedation, inappropriate use of medication, and catheterisation for management ease.</li>
                  <li><strong>Sexual Abuse</strong> – <i>Direct or indirect involvement in sexual activity without consent</i><br />Examples include:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Non Contact: looking, photography, indecent exposure, harassment, serious teasing or innuendo, exposure to pornography.</li>
                      <li>Contact: 	rape, sexual assault or sexual acts to which the vulnerable adult has not consented, could not consent to, or was pressured into consenting. This includes either physical behaviour or remarks of a sexual nature, made towards the client. Examples include touching the client inappropriately or engaging in sexual discussions which have no relevance to the clients care.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Neglect and Acts of Omission</strong> – <i>Ignoring or withholding physical or medical care needs.</i><br />Examples include: Failure to provide appropriate food, shelter, heating, clothing, medical care, hygiene personal care, appropriate medication.</li>
                  <li><strong>Psychological/Emotional Abuse</strong> – <i>That which impinges on the emotional health and development of individuals</i><br />Examples include shouting, swearing, threats, insulting, humiliation, intimidation, ignoring, coercion, denying the right to privacy or choice, blaming or harassment.  This type of abuse is often present alongside other forms of abuse.</li>
                  <li><strong>Financial/Material Abuse</strong> - <i>The unauthorised, fraudulent obtaining and improper use of funds, property or any resources of a vulnerable person</i><br />Examples include borrowing property or money from a client or client’s family member, withholding client’s money or possessions and the inappropriate handling of, or accounting for, a resident’s money or possessions.</li>
                  <li><strong>Disciminatory Abuse</strong> - <i>Abuse of individual rights is a violation of human and civil rights by any other person or persons</i><br />Discriminatory abuse consists of abusive or derisive attitudes or behaviour based on a person’s sex, sexuality, ethnic origin, race, culture, age or disability or any other discriminatory abuse.</li>
                  <li><strong>Professional/Institutional Abuse</strong> - <i>Professional Abuse is the misuse of therapeutic power and abuse of trust by professionals, the failure of professionals to act on suspected abuse/crimes, poor care practice or neglect in services, resource shortfalls or service pressures that lead to service failure and culpability as a result of poor management systems/structures</i><br />Examples of behaviour; Entering into a sexual relationship with a resident, failure to refer disclosure of abuse, poor, ill-informed or outmoded care practice, failure to support vulnerable adult access to health care/treatment, denying vulnerable adult access to professional support and services such as advocacy, service design where groups of users living together are incompatible, punitive responses to challenging behaviours, failure to whistle-blow on issues when internal procedures to highlight issues are exhausted.  The systems and practices in place in the home should be for the residents benefit not for the staff or the homes benefit. Choice where ever possible should be given, and person centred care plans should be used for each resident.</li>
                  <li><strong></strong> - <i>It is also recognised that “self-neglect” can also become an issue and should be identified and engaged with appropriately, taking in to consideration a person’s human rights and privacy concerns</i>.</li>

          <aside>
            <p>In our organisation we will meet the aims of Making Safeguarding Personal:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Keeping the person at the heart of the process;</li>
                <li>Making  efforts  to  understand  the  outcomes  they  want  to  achieve  from  the  adults safeguarding work and support them to achieve those.</li>
              </ul>

            <p>Where a person knows or has a concern that a vulnerable adult has been abused and/or may be the victim of a criminal offence there is a duty and responsibility to contact the police or social services.

              <h3>Possible Signs of Abuse</h3>
            </header>
                <p>The following is a list of general indicators of abuse:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Unexplained injuries or injuries where the description of the “accident” and the injuries do not correspond.</li>
                    <li>The person is quiet and withdrawn.</li>
                    <li>The person is nervous and eager to please.</li>
                    <li>Bruising, particularly to shins and forearms.</li>
                    <li>Withdrawal from physical contact.</li>
                    <li>Appears agitated and anxious, and seeks isolation.</li>
                    <li>Cuts and tears to skin.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>This list is not exhaustive - if in even the slightest doubt, talk to a senior staff member you trust for advice on the situation. The conversation will be in the strictest confidence</p>

              <h3>Responding to a Disclosure</h3>
            </header>
                <p>Any individual becoming aware of potential abuse should take action to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Listen to what the vulnerable adult is saying;</li>
                    <li>Safeguard the vulnerable adult, alerting emergency services if necessary;</li>
                    <li>Record the words of the vulnerable adult and accepting the statements as truth, record the full details, including the time, date and location that the disclosure was made. All written notes must be made as soon as practicable and kept;</li>
                    <li>Discuss and negotiate with the vulnerable adult as to who will be informed and why.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>The initial conversation should be regarded as a source of evidence. It is therefore important to listen and not ask leading questions which may suggest or invite an anticipated answer, and to record the concerns precisely, as expressed by the vulnerable adult and referrer. This initial conversation may become the basis for a formal interview at a later date.</p>
                <p>The appropriate authorities to respond to referrals regarding the possible abuse of a vulnerable adult will be social services and the police. If there are concerns a referral should be made direct to social services or to the police if a criminal offence seems to have been committed. [[Surrey Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH)]]</p>

        <h2>Human Rights & Mental Capacity Act (MCA) Policy</h2>
          <aside>
            <p>The aim of this policy is to ensure that this organisation fully implements the Mental Capacity Act 2005 which sets out how service users who lack capacity should be helped to take decisions and under what circumstances decisions might be taken on their behalf when they lack the ability to do so.</p>
            <p>Staff should be aware that the Act introduced a criminal offence of ill treatment or neglect of a person who lacks capacity. Any person found guilty of such an offence may be liable to imprisonment for a term of up to five years. Organisations may also be liable to prosecution under corporate manslaughter provisions if the ill treatment or neglect resulted in or contributed to the death of a person.</p>
            <p>Certain groups of people are legally required to have regard to the Act and its associated Code of Practice when making decisions on behalf of people who lack mental capacity. This includes doctors, nurses, health and social care managers and staff.  The Act applies only to people aged 16 years and over.</p>

              <h3>Background</h3>
            </header>
              <p>The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents">Mental Capacity Act 2005</a> was introduced into England and Wales in April 2007 and fully implemented in October 2007 when a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/497253/Mental-capacity-act-code-of-practice.pdf">Code of Practice</a> was issued. It has great relevance for the provision of health and social care and in protecting the human rights of service users, particularly protecting them from abuse and improper treatment or care.</p>
              <p>The Mental Capacity Act, or MCA as it is often known, was introduced to provide a statutory framework to protect those who lack the mental capacity to make their own decisions, such as those with severe dementia or any other significant brain dysfunction, and those who are dying and no longer capable of making decisions for themselves.</p>
              <p>Most importantly the MCA sets out:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>who can take decisions for people who lack capacity;</li>
                  <li>in which situations this can be done;</li>
                  <li>how they should go about this.</li>

              <h3>Definition of 'Capacity'</h3>
            </header>
              <p>The ‘capacity’ referred to in the MCA refers to the mental capacity to make a decision. Where a person is described as ‘lacking capacity’ this means that the person is judged as being unable to make a decision for him or herself because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain, whether temporary or permanent.</p>
              <p>Importantly, capacity can change and may relate to different decisions differently. Therefore a lack of capacity should never be assumed or presumed.</p>
              <p>A person’s capacity to make a decision can be affected by a range of factors such as a stroke, dementia, a learning disability or a mental illness – or when they are near end of life. A person’s capacity may also vary over time or according to the type of decision to be made. For example, making decisions about what to eat will demand less mental capacity than making decisions about whether or not to have life-saving surgery.</p>
              <p>Physical conditions, such as an intimidating or unfamiliar environment, can also affect capacity, temporarily preventing people from being able to make decisions, as can trauma, loss, medication and health problems.  Lack of capacity may therefore not be a permanent condition.  Assessments of capacity should be time and decision specific. It cannot be assumed that someone lacks capacity based upon age, appearance, condition or behaviour alone.</p>

              <h3>Key Principles of the Act</h3>
                <aside>
                  <p>According to the following principles, which are legally enforceable in law, all staff involved in the care and treatment of a person who may lack capacity must show that they understand the rights of the person under the law and that they have assessed the person’s capacity appropriately. It is particularly important that they understand that a person’s capacity may change over time depending upon the decision to be made and the individual circumstances.</p>
                </aside>
            </header>
              <p>The Act is underpinned by five key principles set out in Section 1 of the Act:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>A presumption of capacity</strong> - every adult has the right to make his or her own decisions and must be assumed to have capacity to do so unless it is proved otherwise.</li>
                  <li><strong>The right for individuals to be supported to make their own decisions</strong> - people must be given all appropriate help to enable them to make their own decisions before anyone concludes that they cannot do so.</li>
                  <li><strong>Individuals must retain the right to make what might be seen as eccentric or unwise decisions</strong> – it is human nature that people sometimes make poor decisions but that does not mean that they should be judged as unable to take those decisions.</li>
                  <li><strong>The principle of ‘best interests’</strong> – anything done for or on behalf of people without capacity must be in their best interests, taking in to account the person’s past and present wishes and feelings.</li>
                  <li><strong>The least restrictive intervention principle</strong> – anything done for or on behalf of people without capacity should be the least restrictive of their basic rights and freedoms.</li>

              <h3>Assessment of Capacity</h3>
                <aside>
                  <p>An <a href="nhs-dols-pathway.pdf">NHS Mental Capacity Act and Deprivation of Liberty Pathway diagram</a> follows the process of assessing capacity.</p>
                  <p>Staff should be aware of Section 2 of the Act which makes it clear that a lack of capacity cannot be established merely by reference to the person’s age, appearance, or any condition or aspect of a person’s behaviour which might lead others to make unjustified assumptions about capacity. Most people will be able to make most decisions, no matter what their age is and even when they have a label or diagnosis that may seem to imply that they do not have mental capacity, such as dementia.</p>
                  <p>Further guidance on the application of the MCA has been published by <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/rp_poc1b2b_100563_20111223_v4_00_guidance_for_providers_mca_for_external_publication.pdf">CQC</a> and <a href="https://www.scie.org.uk/mca/practice/care-planning">Social Care Institure for Excellence (SCIE)</a>

            </header>
                <h4>The Capacity Tests</h4>
                  <aside>
                    <p>The Act states that any competent person who is aware of the requirements of the MCA can apply the test, they do not have to be a doctor (though professional opinion may be required in complex or major decision cases) or a nurse. The test is Decision-Specific which means that it must be applied for each specific decision. It should never be decided that someone lacks capacity as a result of a particular medical condition or diagnosis and therefore need never be asked. Where used the test should be properly recorded in the service user’s notes.</p>
                    <p>Staff assessing capacity must remember that an unwise or unpopular decision made by the person does not of itself indicate a lack of capacity.</p>
                    <p>A person can put his or her wishes and feelings into a written statement if they so wish, which the person making the determination must consider.</p>
                    <p>If there is a chance that the person will have capacity in the future, the decision should, if at all possible, be delayed until they do.</p>
                  </aside>
                  <p>Staff should use the <strong>2-stage test</strong> set out in the Act for assessing whether, on the balance of probabilities (i.e. it is more likely than not) a person lacks capacity to take a particular decision at a particular time. The <strong>2-stage test</strong> asks:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Is there an impairment of, or disturbance in, the functioning of the person’s mind or brain? If so,</li>
                      <li>Is the impairment or disturbance sufficient that the person lacks the capacity to make that particular decision?</li>
                    </ol>
                  <p>The MCA says that a person is unable to make their own decision if they cannot do one or more of the following four things (the <strong>4-stage test</strong>):</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>understand information given to them;</li><br /><strong>OR</strong>
                      <li>retain the information long enough to be able to make the decision;</li><br /><strong>OR</strong>
                      <li>weight up the information available to make the decision;</li><br /><strong>OR</strong>
                      <li>communicate their decision (in any way, including sign language, blinking, squeezing a hand  or muscle movement).</li>
                    </ol>

                <h4>Recording the Capacity Assessment</h4>
                  <p>A clearly recorded assessment of capacity, with supporting evidence should be kept, where someone is deemed to lack capacity to consent to their care and support plan, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The decision;</li>
                      <li>how the person was assisted to understand the decision;</li>
                      <li>the impairment;</li>
                      <li>how this affects the person’s capacity;</li>
                      <li>whether the decision can be delayed;</li>
                      <li>a reasonable belief (i.e. more likely than not) that the person lacks capacity to make the decision;</li>
                      <li>any referral to the commissioning body if there is a dispute.</li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>Staff should be aware of circumstances in which it is necessary to involve external professionals and agencies, ensuring written records of assessments and decisions are kept and confirmation by the professional is obtained where they are appropriately involved in assessments and decisions.</p>

                <h4>Assessments of Day-to-Day Decisions</h4>
                  <p>Where assessments of capacity relate to day–to-day decisions and caring actions, such as helping someone to wash or get out of bed, no formal assessment procedures or documentation is required. However if a decision is challenged the member of staff must be able to describe why they had a reasonable belief of lack of capacity. Anyone making a decision in the best interests of a person who lacks capacity is specifically warned in the Act not to make assumptions that cannot be clearly justified.</p>

                <h4>Assessments of Highly Significant Decisions</h4>
                  <p>Where the decision is about highly significant matters, such as financial, medical or end of life matters, the assessment process has to be clear and accountable and requires input from staff across the range of organisations involved in providing support for a person. In such cases it should include family and carers and, where there is no family or carer, an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA) may be assigned where appropriate.</p>

                <h4>Restraint & Restrictions</h4>
                  <p>Restraint should only ever be used in compliance with the Act as a last resort or in exceptional circumstances. It is defined in the Act as the use or threat of force where an incapacitated person resists, and any restriction of liberty or movement, whether or not the person resists. It is only permitted if the person using it reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent harm to the person who lacks capacity, and if the restraint used is proportionate to the likelihood and seriousness of the harm.</p>

                <h4>Advance Decisions</h4>
                  <p>Staff should be aware of how the Act relates to Advance Decisions, decisions made by a person in case there comes a time when they no longer have the capacity to make a decision. In such cases the Advance Decision, where properly made, should be acted upon. Further guidance is set out in Birtley House’s policies on end of life care and on advance decisions.</p>

                <h4>Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA)</h4>
                  <p>Staff should be aware that in situations where decisions are being made about serious medical treatment for a person who lacks capacity and has no one to speak for them, such as family or friends, the Act makes provision for them to be supported by an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA). The IMCA makes representations about the person’s wishes, feelings, beliefs and values, at the same time as bringing to the attention of the decision-maker all factors that are relevant to the decision. The IMCA can challenge the decision-maker on behalf of the person lacking capacity if necessary.</p>

                <h4>Lasting Power of Attorney</h4>
                  <p>Staff should be aware that the Act allows a person to appoint someone with Lasting Powers of Attorney to act on their behalf if they lose capacity in the future. An attorney must be over 18 and can be a family member, friend, care worker or professional. They are always subject to the provisions of the Act, particularly the core principles and the best interests requirements.</p>

                <h4>Deprivation of Liberty</h4>
                  <p>If a situation arises where a resident requires care, treatment or some form of intervention but they cannot make a decision about this because of a lack of mental capacity, but it is felt in their best interests to proceed with it, we first try to ascertain if it would lead to the person being deprived of their liberty as a result. In these circumstances, please see <a href="#policyDeprivationOfLiberty">Policy on Deprivation of Liberty</a></p>

              <p>All staff will be expected to read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/497253/Mental-capacity-act-code-of-practice.pdf">Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice</a> issued on 23 April 2007 in accordance with sections 42 and 43 of the Act.</p>
              <p>Staff are encouraged to think about capacity in the course of their work and to discuss how they consider and implement capacity issues.</p>
              <p>Training will emphasise the need for staff to respect and consider the rights, dignity, privacy, autonomy and freedom of the individual.</p>
              <p>Training should be included in induction and refreshed as necessary. Full records of training should be kept.</p>
              <p>Staff will be made aware of how to access this and other related policies, including Duty of Candour and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards.</p>

          <h4>Responsibilities</h4>
          <p>Responsibility for the implementation, monitoring and review of this policy lies with the Registered Manager.</p>
          <p>The policy will be reviewed on an annual basis.</p>
          <p>I have raised a couple of questions in the policy as my concern is that it does not always give practical guidance to the reader.  It also does not cover the role of the Court of Protection or the public guardian which, you will be aware, the CQC says staff should know about.  I assume this would be covered in your staff training.</p>
          <p>There is a reference to Advance Decisions being discussed in the end of life care policy which they do not seem to be. You will want to amend one or the other to ensure consistency.</p>

          <h2>Deprivation of Liberty Policy</h2>
            <aside>
              <p>From 1 April 2009 any care home or hospital treating or caring for a person in such a way that they are depriving that person of their liberty is required to seek authority to do so.  This document has been written to explain the process that must be followed in order to obtain authorisation if there is not already authority given by the court.</p>
              <p>Deprivation of Liberty is an evolving area with the current processes due to replaced in the near future.  The <a href="state-of-care-dols.pdf">CQC 2017/18 State of Care report</a> covers what good practice in applying DoLS looks like – it emphasises regular training and the importance of the registered manager and staff having a good knowledge of DoLS, the MCA and fluctuating capacity. It gives examples of homes where the DoLS authorisation had been removed as capacity improved and the resident regained the ability to make relevant decisions.</p>

              </header>
                <p>This policy is written in accordance with the regulatory framework provided by the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents">Mental Capacity Act 2005</a>, the <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/Deprivation%20of%20liberty%20safeguards%20code%20of%20practice.pdf">Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Code of Practice 2009</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/497253/Mental-capacity-act-code-of-practice.pdf">Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice</a>.  This policy should be read with the Company's <a href="#policyMentalCapacityAct">Human Rights & Mental Capacity Act (MCA) Policy</a>.</p>
                <p>In particular, this policy aims to ensure the Five Statutory Principles are properly implemented:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established they lack capacity.</li>
                    <li>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help them to do so have been taken without success.</li>
                    <li>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision.</li>
                    <li>An act done or decision made, under the Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or made in, the person’s best interests.</li>
                    <li>Before the act is done, or the decision is made, regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person’s rights and freedom of action.</li>

              </header>
                  <p>At Birtley House, the “Managing Authority” is the Registered Manager. The Registered Manager is responsible for all aspects of procedure relating to the Deprivation of Liberty of Relevant Persons.</p>
                  <p>The Supervisory Body will be the local social services authority (LSSA) arranging, paying for, or contributing to the Relevant Person’s care. If the person is self-funding or financed under continuing care or was of no fixed abode before admission or the Registered Manager cannot ascertain where they normally lived, application for authorisation will be sent to the local authority in which the home is located.</p>

                <h3>Admission</h3>
                  <aside>
                    <p>When a Relevant Person is referred to the home, the Registered Manager will ensure that the referrer identifies any possibility that there may be a need for a deprivation of liberty authorisation. This authorisation should be applied for 28 days before the deprivation of liberty is due to start.  In the case of an admission from the social service or NHS, they will normally inform you well before admission, however, when family arranges a placement or others it is likely that the Registered Manager will need to raise the issue.</p>
                  </aside>
              </header>
                    <p>The Registered Manager will ensure that the potential Relevant Person has their mental capacity to agree to residing at the home assessed. If they lack capacity to consent to the admission then the Registered Manager will require the referrer to supply information about the following:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Does the Relevant Person have anyone with Lasting Power of Attorney?</li>
                        <li>If so, is the LPA for Health and Personal Welfare issues?</li>
                        <li>Does the person have a deputy appointed by the Court of Protection?</li>
                        <li>If so, is the Deputy empowered for Health and Personal Welfare issues?</li>
                        <li>Has the person made any Advance Decisions to Refuse Medical Treatment, which apply to anything, which may happen while they are in the home?</li>
                        <li>Does the referrer know of any wishes and feelings expressed by the Relevant Person, which relate to their care? (These are sometimes called advance statements).</li>
                        <li>Do they have a list of people who should be consulted when a major decision is being made?</li>
                      </ol>
              <footer>
                <p>If it is determined that the pre-admission assessment does not indicate a deprivation of liberty authorisation is necessary but circumstances change on admission then the Registered Manager will follow the urgent authorisation procedure.</p>

                <h3>Identifying if authorisation is needed</h3>
                  <aside>
                    <p>The Registered Manager will ensure that all residents are assessed for a need for authorisation. This will normally be pre-admission but on occasions will be post-admission.  Sometimes a person will be admitted with no need for authorisation but because of changes in their condition the need develops over time. The home’s ongoing assessments will recognise this before deprivation is actually necessary and the Registered Manager will apply to the supervisory body for authorisation.</p>
                    <p>A summary of the process is presented as a flowchart in <a href="referral-for-authorisation-of-dols.pdf">Appendix B: Referral for Authorisation of Deprivation of Liberty</a></p>

              </header>
                  <h4>Determining a Deprivation of Liberty</h4>
                    <p>The basis for determining whether a person is deprived of liberty is subject to an evolving legal position.  The starting point should be the specific facts of the Relevant Person’s situation.  A range of factors should be considered, including the type, duration, manner and implementation of the measure in question.  Whether there has been a deprivation of liberty will then be a question of degree and intensity.  The “Acid Test” set out by the Supreme Court in Cheshire West, when assessing if the Relevant Person is deprived of liberty, is whether that person is:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Under continuous or complete supervision and control;</li>
                        <li>Not free to leave;</li>
                        <li>Lacks capacity to consent to these arrangements.</li>
                      </ol>

                  <h4>Urgent Life-saving Medical Treatment</h4>
                    <p>This policy also takes in to consideration the recent guidance resulting from the Ferreira court of appeal judgement, of which staff will be made aware.  In light of this guidance, authorisation will not be sought for depriving the Relevant Person of their liberty where the need to do so arises in the context of urgent life-saving medical treatment, in accordance with regulation 17 Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  Such circumstances would arise where:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>The relevant Person lacked capacity to make decisions about their own care as a consequence of their physical health condition (for example, they are unconscious);</li><br /><strong>AND</strong><br />
                        <li>The patient would have been treated the same way irrespective of whether they had the capacity to make their own decisions when conscious; </li><br /><strong>AND</strong><br />
                        <li>If the patient were conscious and chose to leave, they would not be prevented from doing so.</li>
                      </ol>

                  <h4>Indicators of a potential Deprivation of Liberty</h4>
                    <p>If the Registered Manager believes that the arrangements for care MIGHT represent deprivation of liberty, they must apply for authorisation.</p>
                    <p>Points, which MIGHT indicate Deprivation of Liberty, include:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>•	Restraint or sedation on admission where the resident resists.</li>
                        <li>Complete and effective control over care and movement of the person.</li>
                        <li>Control over assessments, treatment, contacts and residence.</li>
                        <li>A decision has been made that the person will not be released to the care of others, or permitted to live elsewhere, unless the staff consider it appropriate.</li>
                        <li>There has been a refusal to let the person live with a relative.</li>
                        <li>The person’s social contacts are determined for them, e.g. they are not allowed contact with particular people including relatives.</li>
                        <li>Ongoing restraint or sedation required.</li>
                        <li>The person receives sedative medication for which they do not have capacity to consent.</li>
                        <li>The person is restricted to a small part of the home.</li>
                        <li>The person receives high level of observation.</li>
                        <li>The person seems to be trying to leave.</li>

                    <aside>
                      <p>The balance of these issues and others will determine deprivation of liberty.  If none of these apply, then it is unlikely that there is a deprivation of liberty. It is a requirement that where a deprivation of liberty is authorised it must be the least restrictive option that is proportionate to the need to prevent harm and is in the Relevant Person’s best interest.</p>

                          <li>If there is a chance that the person will have capacity in the future, the decision should, if at all possible, be delayed until they do.</li>
                          <li>The person should be encouraged and helped to join in making the decision when possible.</li>
                          <li>If the decision is about life sustaining medical treatment, it must not be motivated by a wish to hasten a person’s death.</li>
                          <li>The person’s past and present wishes, feelings, beliefs and values must be considered.</li>

                      <p>The assessors will need to see information held about the Relevant Person to help them come to a decision. This information might include:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Evidence of age.</li>
                          <li>Information about their daily care and treatment.</li>
                          <li>Care plans and risk assessments.</li>
                          <li>Information about illnesses.</li>
                          <li>Contact information for family and others.</li>
                          <li>Forms relating to legal issues, such as the Act.</li>
                          <li>Evidence to show that deprivation is the least restrictive option.</li>
                          <li>Any information regarding mental capacity such as:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Any notes about what the Relevant Person may have said about wishes, views and feelings;</li>
                              <li>Any information about people with a Lasting Power of Attorney for the Relevant Person;</li>
                              <li>Any advance decisions to refuse medical treatment the Relevant Person may have on their file;</li>
                              <li>Other information they consider relevant.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                        </ul>

                      <p>It is possible that an assessment may take place outside normal working hours and staff on duty should be made aware of this.</p>
                      <p>During the assessment, however, staff still have a duty of care to the Relevant Person. They should raise concerns with the assessor if they sense the Relevant Person being assessed, whom they know better than the assessor, is becoming distressed.</p>
                      <p>The time from the point at which the Supervisory Body accepts the referral to the issuing of a standard authorisation should not be more than 21 days.</p>
                      <p>When an urgent authorisation has been granted to the home, the assessment has to be completed within 7 days. Under special circumstances the Supervisory Body can extend this by a further 7 days.</p>
                      <p>To apply for a standard authorisation the Registered Manager must complete <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/676365/form-1-standard-and-urgent-request.odt">Form 1 – standard and urgent request</a>.</p>
                      <p>It is vital that the whole form is completed or the assessment will be delayed or prolonged. The form is to be sent to the Supervisory Body for the Relevant Person or potential Relevant Person.</p>
                      <p>The assessors will submit their reports to the Supervisory Body and an authorisation will be issued. Authorisation can be given for any period up to 1 year. In unstable situations it is likely that the period will be considerably less than one year.</p>
                      <p>The authorisation is an important legal document and must be filed as part of the Relevant Person’s records. The authorisation may include conditions to which the managing authority and all staff must adhere to make the Deprivation of Liberty legal. When authorisation is received, the Registered Manager is responsible for instructing all staff that will have contact with the Relevant Person in any conditions, which apply.</p>
                      <p>This briefing process will be recorded within the Relevant Person’s record. All staff members present at the briefing are to sign the record to provide evidence that the briefing has taken place and they fully understand what is expected of them.</p>

                      <p>The Registered Manager (Managing Authority) has an ongoing duty to review whether or not a Deprivation of Liberty Authorisation is still required.</p>
                      <p>There are three circumstances under which this should be done:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>When there are any changes in a Relevant Person’s condition or arrangements which may indicate a change in their need for deprivation of liberty;</li><br /><strong>OR</strong></br />
                          <li>When a period of authorised deprivation is coming to an end;</li><br /><strong>OR</strong></br />
                          <li>If the Registered Manager (Managing Authority) is not certain about the need for continued deprivation of liberty.</li>
                        </ul>
                      <p>As soon as the Registered Manager (Managing Authority) thinks that they can look after the Relevant Person safely without the need to deprive them of their liberty, they should do so immediately.</p>
                      <p>All decisions in relation to a review should be recorded in the Care Plan.</p>
                      <p>A request for a review will be made to the Supervisory Body using <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/676377/form-10-review-request.odt">Form 10 – review request</a>.</p>

                  <h3>Urgent Authorisation</h3>
                    <aside>
                      <p>There will be occasions when it is discovered that a person who is already admitted is living under circumstances, which may indicate that they are being deprived of their liberty without a valid authorisation. As soon as this is suspected it is the legal duty of the Registered Manager (Managing Authority) to grant themselves an Urgent authorisation. If there is no authorisation the deprivation would be illegal and the Registered Manager (Managing Authority) would be liable for prosecution. It is essential therefore that action is taken the instant that deprivation of liberty is suspected.</p>

                </header>
                      <p>To grant an Urgent Authorisation the Registered Manager (Managing Authority) must:</p>

                          <li>Complete <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/676365/form-1-standard-and-urgent-request.odt">Form 1 – standard and urgent request</a>;</li>
                        </ul>
                      <p>If the Registered Manager (Managing Authority) is not available to complete and sign the forms, it will be done by one of his/her delegated representatives, the list of these delegated staff is held by the most senior person on duty.</p>
                      <p>The Urgent Authorisation lasts for 7 days. Day one starts the day the authorisation is signed and dated. The Supervisory Body may extend this by a further 7 days in exceptional circumstances.

                </header>
                      <p>There are separate review arrangements for cases in which the eligibility requirement ceases to be met for a short period of time. For example, if the Relevant Person is detained as a hospital in-patient under the Mental Health Act 1983, the managing authority must notify the supervisory body, who will suspend the authorisation – <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/676374/form-7-suspension-of-standard-authorisation.odt">Form 7 - suspension of standard authorisation</a> is be used.</p>
                      <p>If the Relevant Person then becomes eligible again within 28 days, the managing authority must notify the supervisory body who will remove the suspension. If no such notice is given within 28 days, then the authorisation will be terminated – <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/676374/form-7-suspension-of-standard-authorisation.odt">Form 7 - suspension of standard authorisation</a> is be used.</p>
