                  <p>The Company is responsible for paying SSP to you if you are eligible.
                  <p>The maximum period for which SSP is payable is 28 weeks in one period of sickness absence and is paid at a rate specified by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay">law</a>.

                  <p>SSP is paid in respect of qualifying days on which you are unable to work through sickness. Qualifying days are those days on which you would normally work. Generally SSP is not payable for the first three qualifying days of sickness which are known as “waiting days”, but this may not always be the case if you are absent on more than one occasion within a short period of time.</p>
                  <p>SSP is only paid when the sickness absence is for four or more consecutive qualifying days.</p>

                  <p>The notice periods detailed below must be complied with in order to safeguard your rights.

                  <p>If you take the full entitlement to maternity leave your return date will be the date previously notified to you by the Company.</p>
                  <p>If you wish to return early you must give the Company eight weeks’ written notice of your early return date. Your early return may be delayed if this procedure is not followed.</p>
                  <p>If you intend to return to work at the end of your maternity leave but fail to do so, the Company’s normal rules regarding absence will apply.</p>

                <h4 id="section2.5.6">Maternity benefits</h4>
                  <p>Although you do not need any qualifying service or work a minimum number of hours to be entitled to maternity leave or the right to return to work, in order to qualify for Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) from the Company, you need to have the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>at least 26 weeks continuous service at the end of the 15th week before the <dfn title="Expected week of childbirth means the week, beginning with midnight between Saturday and Sunday, in which it is expected that childbirth will occur">Expected Week of Childbirth (EWC)</dfn> (this is known as the “qualifying week” for maternity pay purposes);</li>
                      <li>average earnings above the <dfn title="If you earn between the Lower Earning Limit and the Primary Threshold you will get National Insurance ‘credits’ – that is you will be entitled to some basic National Insurance benefits, but won’t actually pay any National Insurance">National Insurance lower earnings limit</dfn> during the eight weeks before the qualifying week.</li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>This year's National Insurance Thresholds can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rates-and-thresholds-for-employers-2017-to-2018">here</a>.</p>
                  <p>If you meet these conditions you are entitled to a maximum of 39 weeks SMP which is calculated as:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>weeks at 90% of average weekly earnings;</li>
                      <li>3 weeks at the lesser of the lower rate of SMP or 90% of average weekly earnings.</li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>You can calculate your SMP <a href="https://www.gov.uk/maternity-paternity-calculator">here</a>.</p>
                  <p>If you do not qualify for SMP you may be entitled to <dfn title="You might get Maternity Allowance for 39 weeks if you’re employed, but you can’t get Statutory Maternity Pay, you’re self-employed and pay Class 2 National Insurance (including voluntary National Insurance) or you’ve recently stopped working.  In the 66 weeks before your baby’s due, you must also have been employed or self-employed for at least 26 weeks earning (or classed as earning) £30 a week or more in at least 13 weeks - the weeks don’t have to be together.  You may still qualify if you’ve recently stopped working. It doesn’t matter if you had different jobs or periods of unemployment.">Maternity Allowance</dfn></p>

                <h4 id="section2.5.7">Sickness absence during pregnancy</h4>
                  <p>If you are absent from work because of a pregnancy related illness or reason at any time during the four weeks before your <dfn title="Expected week of childbirth means the week, beginning with midnight between Saturday and Sunday, in which it is expected that childbirth will occur">Expected Week of Childbirth (EWC)</dfn>, the ordinary maternity leave period begins on the first day of absence. If the pregnancy related absence began before the fourth week, then the ordinary maternity leave period begins at the start of the fourth week.</p>
                  <p>If you are absent from work and the illness is not pregnancy related, the maternity leave period will begin on the date you have previously notified.</p>
                  <p>If you are absent from work in the weeks leading up to your maternity leave it may affect the higher rate of SMP (90% of normal pay) because it is based on your average earnings in the eight weeks prior to the qualifying week.</p>
                <h4 id="section2.5.8">"Keeping in touch" days</h4>
                  <p>You are allowed, with the Company's agreement, to work on up to 10 ‘keeping in touch’ (KIT) days during your maternity leave period without breaking your entitlement to maternity leave or to SMP, if payable. Normal pay is paid for KIT days, but this is offset against any SMP that may be payable, so if you earn less on KIT days in an SMP week than the weekly rate of SMP, you will only receive the equivalent of SMP for that week. If you earn more on KIT days in an SMP week than the weekly rate of SMP, you will only receive payment for your KIT days.</p>
                  <p>Any work carried out on a KIT day counts as a whole KIT day for the purpose of the 10-day limit and any missed days of maternity leave are lost and do not extend the maternity leave period. There is no compulsion for you to work on any requested KIT day, and you cannot insist on being offered KIT days.</p>

                <h4 id="section2.9.1">Introduction</h4>
                  <p>Many parents will be able to share leave in the year after their child’s birth and take leave in a more flexible way by stopping and starting their shared parental leave, taking their leave at the same time, and returning to work between periods of leave.</p><p>To qualify for shared parental leave you must have at least 26 weeks continuous service at the end of the 15th week before the <dfn title="Expected week of childbirth means the week, beginning with midnight between Saturday and Sunday, in which it is expected that childbirth will occur">Expected Week of Childbirth (EWC)</dfn> and still be in employment the week before you take the shared parental leave. In addition, you must share the main responsibility for the care of the child that the shared parental leave and pay relates to with the other parent and meet an ‘employment and earnings’ test.</p>
                <h4 id="section2.9.2">Opting into shared parental leave and pay</h4>
                  <p>If the mother and her partner agree, the mother can curtail her current maternity leave and ‘convert’ what remains of the leave period into shared parental leave (SPL).</p><p>The mother must do this by giving formal notice to her employer and, if you are the mother, we have a form that can be completed to provide the required information. At least eight weeks’ notice must be given to curtail maternity leave, at which time the mother and her partner must also give their respective employers an indication of how they intend to take the shared parental leave and pay.</p><p>The mother’s notice to curtail maternity leave will normally be accompanied by a notice of entitlement to take shared parental leave and a request for a period of shared parental leave and pay. Once notice to curtail maternity leave has been given, it can only be withdrawn in very limited circumstances. However, if the mother gives notice to curtail her maternity leave before the child is born, she has up to six weeks after the birth to change her mind. If the mother revokes her curtailment notice, she remains on maternity leave and can give a new notice to curtail her maternity leave at a later date.
                  </p>
                <h4 id="section2.9.3">Taking shared parental leave</h4>
                  <p>Before you can take shared parental leave and pay you must provide your employer with a notice of your entitlement to shared parental leave and pay, and this must be accompanied by a ‘declaration’ from your partner. This is a ‘one off’ notice and, if you are the mother, you will already have given this notice with your notice to curtail your maternity leave. If you are the mother’s partner we have a form that can be completed to provide the required information. The total number of weeks of SPL available is 52 weeks minus the maternity leave that the mother has already taken (including the compulsory maternity leave period). The leave must be taken in whole weeks (part-weeks count as whole weeks), and it must be taken before the child’s first birthday.</p><p>All your terms and conditions of employment are maintained throughout the SPL period with the sole exception of pay and, if your combined total of maternity/paternity and SPL does not exceed 26 weeks, you are entitled to return to work in your old job. If you work full time you have the right to return to your full time position; you do not have the right to return part time. However, your employer will discuss any request for part time work and will, if practicable, offer part time work. Requests should be made in writing to your employer, giving as much notice as possible.
                  </p>
                <h4 id="section2.9.4">Notification</h4>
                  <p>You are allowed to serve up to three ‘notifications’ to take a period of SPL. A minimum of eight weeks’ notice must be given before each period of leave, and the mother’s first notice to take SPL will usually be included as part of the notice to curtail maternity leave.</p><p>If your notice is for a continuous period of SPL, for example six weeks off, it cannot be refused. If, however, your notice is for a discontinuous period of leave, for example nine weeks comprising three weeks of SPL, three weeks in work, then three weeks of SPL, this can be refused. The first two weeks of the eight week notice period are to enable you and your employer to discuss this type of request and to try to reach agreement on the pattern of leave.</p><p>If agreement cannot be reached you have until the 15th day after you submitted your request (i.e. the day after the discussion period expires) to either let the request stand or to withdraw the request. If you let the request stand your employer can insist that the SPL is taken as a period of continuous leave (in the above example as a continuous period of six weeks). You then have five days in which to decide the start date for the period of continuous leave, which must be at least eight weeks after the date on which your period of leave notice was given to the Company, otherwise it will start on the date of the first period you previously notified. Alternatively, you can withdraw the request and it will not count as one of your three notifications.</p><p>If you want to change the dates of a previously notified period of SPL and your employer agrees to this, then the change does not count as a formal ‘notification’. If, however, your employer does not agree to the change you can submit a formal notification of the change (giving at least eight weeks’ notice). Your employer will have to accept this notification, but the change will count as one of your three ‘notifications’.

                  <p>If you qualified for SMP or SPP you will also qualify for Statutory Shared Parental Pay (SSPP). The total number of weeks of SSPP available is 39 weeks minus the number of weeks of SMP already paid to the mother. SSPP is paid at the lesser of:</p>

                      <li>the standard rate of SSPP or</li>

                  <p>You are allowed, with the Company’s agreement, to work on up to 20 ‘shared parental leave in touch’ (SPLIT) days during your shared parental leave period without breaking your entitlement to SPL or to SSPP, if payable. SPLIT days are separate and additional to any KIT days. Normal pay is paid for SPLIT days, but this is offset against any SSPP that may be payable, so if you earn less on SPLIT days in an SSPP week than the weekly rate of SSPP, you will only receive the equivalent of SSPP for that week. If you earn more on SPLIT days in an SSPP week than the weekly rate of SSPP, you will only receive payment for your SPLIT days.</p><p>Any work carried out on a SPLIT day counts as a whole SPLIT day for the purpose of the 20- day limit and any missed days of shared parental leave are lost and do not extend the shared parental leave period. There is no compulsion for you to work on any requested SPLIT day, and you cannot insist on being offered SPLIT days.</p>

              <p>Parents of children born or placed for adoption on or after 15th December 1999 are entitled, on completion of one year’s service with the Company, to take unpaid parental leave. The right applies to mothers and fathers and to a person who has legal parental responsibility. Parents who already have at least one year’s service are able to start taking parental leave when the child is born or adopted and the remainder are able to start taking parental leave as soon as they have completed one year’s service.</p><p>Parents are entitled to 18 weeks’ leave for each child, to be taken before the child’s 18th birthday.</p><p>Parents must give 21 days’ written notice to take parental leave and it must be taken in blocks or multiples of one week (part weeks, including single days or part days, count as whole weeks) up to a maximum of four weeks in any one year. Parents of disabled children must give 21 days’ written notice and have the additional flexibility to take leave in days without them being counted as whole weeks, although part days count as full days.
              </p><p>Leave can be postponed by the Company for up to six months where the business cannot cope, except when a father gives the above advance notice to take leave immediately after the date when the child is born or when the partner of a primary adopter gives the above advance notice to take leave immediately after the date when the child is placed for adoption.</p>

Whilst the use of DSE carries no undue risks to health, the Company recognises that some employees may have genuine reservations and concerns.</p><p>An assessment will be carried out to determine whether or not an employee who works on DSE is a “user” within the meaning of the health & safety legislation. A user is someone who habitually uses the equipment as a significant part of his or her work and where continuous spells at the workstation of an hour or more are encountered.</p><p>For designated users, the Company will:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>attempt to incorporate changes of tasks within the working day, in order to prevent intensive periods of on-screen activity</li>
                  <li>review software to ensure suitability for the task and provide any additional training necessary</li>
                  <li>arrange, on request, for the provision of initial eyesight tests and thereafter, as may be necessary</li>
                  <li>arrange for the free supply of any corrective appliances (glasses) where required specifically for working with DSE</li>

            <header><h3>Disciplinary procedure</h3></header>
          </header>
              <h4 id="section5.1.1">Summary</h4>
                <p>the Company firmly believes that the fairest way to resolve any problems relating to conduct or performance is to have a well-structured disciplinary procedure. The procedure is designed to help and encourage all employees to achieve and maintain the Company’s standards of conduct, attendance and performance and should be looked upon as a corrective process.</p><p>Apart from an informal verbal warning, you have the following rights in relation to disciplinary action:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>to be informed of the allegations of misconduct or poor performance to be addressed at any disciplinary hearing</li>
                    <li>to be accompanied by a work colleague or by an accredited trade union official, and </li>
                    <li>to appeal against any disciplinary action.</li>
                  </ul>
              <h4 id="section5.1.2">Formal verbal warning</h4>
                <p>In the case of conduct, attendance or performance not reaching the required standard, the problem will be discussed with you at a disciplinary hearing where you will be given the opportunity to offer a satisfactory explanation. If the explanation is unsatisfactory, you will be issued with a formal verbal warning. The topics discussed at the meeting will be confirmed in writing to you and the verbal warning will remain on your file for six months.</p>
              <h4 id="section5.1.3">Written warning</h4>
                <p>A written warning will be issued following a disciplinary hearing where there is a current formal verbal warning on your file and sufficient improvement has not been made or where the misconduct or poor performance is serious enough to warrant the Company bypassing the formal verbal warning stage. A written warning will remain on file for 12 months.</p>
              <h4 id="section5.1.4">Final written warning</h4>
                <p>If there is still insufficient improvement in your conduct, or if your performance is still unsatisfactory, you will be asked to attend a further disciplinary hearing. If no satisfactory explanation is offered for the lack of improvement, you will be issued with a final written warning that will remain on file for 12 months.</p><p>If the misconduct is sufficiently serious to warrant only one warning but is not sufficiently serious to justify dismissal, a final written warning will be issued. You will be informed in your final written warning that any further misconduct or failure to meet the required standard will result in your dismissal.</p>
              <h4 id="section5.1.5">Dismissal</h4>
                <p>Dismissal will normally result if you still fail to achieve the standard of conduct or performance required by the Company. You will be given every opportunity to offer an explanation for your failure to meet the required standards at a final disciplinary hearing. As with all previous stages of the disciplinary procedure you will be offered the right to be accompanied and the right to appeal against the decision.</p>
                <p>If you are dismissed you will be provided, as soon as is reasonably practicable, with the reasons for dismissal, the date on which your employment will terminate and details of how you may appeal.</p>
                <p>In exceptional circumstances, the Company reserves the right, as an alternative to dismissal, to impose a penalty of suspension without pay for up to a maximum of five working days, together with a final written warning that will remain on file for 12 months.</p>
                <aside>You will always be given as much information as possible regarding the allegations of misconduct, or any documentation detailing the shortfall in performance or capability that will form the basis of the disciplinary hearing. You will also be given fair and reasonable notice of the date and time of the hearing and whenever possible the disciplinary hearing will be held during your normal working hours.</p>
                <p>Any disciplinary action will only be taken after a full investigation of the facts, and if it is necessary to suspend you for this period of time, you will receive your normal rate of pay.</p>
                <p>the Company reserves the right to vary the disciplinary procedure dependent on either the seriousness of the allegations of misconduct or capability to be addressed, or if you only have a short amount of service.</p>
                <p>If you are a short service employee or are still within the probationary period, you may not be issued with any warnings before dismissal.</p>
                <p><strong>We reserve the right to deduct from pay the cost of any damage or loss to property or goods, which after a disciplinary hearing was found to have been caused by your negligence or vandalism.</strong></aside>

              <h4 id="section5.1.6">Conduct at work</h4>
                <p>the Company expects all employees to behave in a normal and reasonable manner. The following list provides examples of the type of conduct that the Company would expect:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>To be punctual for the start of work and to keep within the break times.</li>
                    <li>To give regular attendance at work and to minimise all absenteeism.</li>
                    <li>To be courteous, helpful and polite to all those with whom you have contact.</li>
                    <li>To devote all your time and attention, whilst at work, to the Company and ensure that all its property including confidential information, records, equipment, etc., is kept safe and used correctly.</li>
                    <li>To comply with all the Company’s rules and regulations and to observe and perform all the terms of your employment as set out or referred to in your <dfn title="A contract is an agreement that sets out an employee’s employment conditions, rights, responsibilities and duties.  These are called the ‘terms’ of the contract">Contract of Employment</dfn> and in this Handbook.</li>
                    <li>Not to be involved with any home, client or agent who is in direct competition with this Home.  You are expected to devote all your loyalty to this Home.</li>
                    <li>To speak in English during working hours. The only exception being during your specified break times.</li>
                  </ul>
              <h4 id="section5.1.7">Conduct outside working hours</h4>
                <p>Normally the Company has no jurisdiction over employee activity outside working hours. Behaviour outside working hours will only become an issue if the activities adversely affect the Company.</p><p>Adverse publicity, bringing the Company’s name into disrepute, or actions that result in loss of faith in the Company, resulting in loss of business, or loss of faith in the integrity of the individual, will result in the disciplinary procedure being instigated.</p><p>The detriment suffered by the Company will determine the level of misconduct and it will also determine which disciplinary stage is most appropriate to suit the circumstances.</p><p>If the actions cause extreme embarrassment or serious damage to the Company’s reputation or image, a decision may be taken to terminate the employment.</p><p>the Company’s procedures covering disciplinary hearings and appeals still apply.</p>
              <h4 id="section5.1.8">Gross misconduct</h4>
                <p>Gross misconduct will result in summary dismissal, which means you lose your right to notice or pay in lieu of notice.</p><p>Here is a list of offences that are normally regarded as “gross misconduct”. It is not exhaustive, but it describes the kind of offence that can result in summary dismissal:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Deliberate failure to comply with the published rules of the Company, including those covering security, health and safety, equal opportunities, the Internet, etc.
                    <li>Deliberate falsification of records.</li>
                    <li>The committing of offences against current discrimination legislation whilst acting on behalf of the Company.</li>
                    <li>Fighting or assaulting another person.</li>
                    <li>Using threatening or offensive language towards residents and clients, visitors or other employees.</li>
                    <li>Making yourself unfit to work by solvent abuse, drinking alcohol, taking of illegal substances or failing to follow medical instructions on prescribed drugs.</li>
                    <li>Borrowing money or property from any resident.</li>
                    <li>Being in unauthorised possession of our property or residents and clients’ property.</li>
                    <li>Being in possession of illegal drugs and substances or alcohol whilst on the Company’s premises.</li>
                    <li>Obscene behaviour.</li>
                    <li>Behaviour likely to bring the Company into disrepute.</li>
                    <li>Wilful and deliberate damage to or misuse of the Company’s property.</li>
                    <li>Refusal to carry out reasonable duties or instructions.</li>
                    <li>Sleeping whilst on wakeful duties.</li>
                    <li>Conviction on a criminal charge that is relevant to your employment with the Company.</li>
                    <li>The misuse, including use for personal gain, of confidential information in the course of working for the Company.</li>
                    <li>Undertaking private work on the premises without permission.</li>
                  </ul>
              <h4 id="section5.1.9">Disciplinary appeal procedure</h4>
                <p>At each stage of the disciplinary procedure, you will be given the right of appeal. If you wish to exercise your right of appeal, you should put your reasons in writing to a Director within five days of receiving written confirmation of the disciplinary decision taken against you. You will need to explain why you feel the decision is unfair or inappropriate in relation to the matters addressed at the disciplinary hearing.</p><p>If you have any new information or evidence to support your appeal, please give details in full and include the names of any witnesses you may wish to call to support you in your appeal. This is in order that there will be sufficient time to investigate any additional information before the appeal hearing. You are entitled to be accompanied at the appeal hearing by a work colleague or by an accredited trade union official.</p><p>Although the purpose of the appeal is to review any disciplinary penalty imposed, it cannot increase the disciplinary penalty.
                </p><p>The decision of the person dealing with your appeal is final.</p>

            <header><h3>Whistleblowing procedure</h3></header>
          </header>
              <h4 id="section5.3.1">Summary</h4>
                <p>Employees and workers who make public disclosures, about wrongdoings in the workplace are commonly referred to as “whistleblowers”. In the past, employees were sometimes dismissed or victimised by their employers, which discouraged ‘whistleblowing’. However, ‘whistleblowers’ now have legal protection under certain circumstances.</p><p>Not all ‘whistleblowing’ is protected. The legal protection is only for ‘qualifying disclosures’, which must relate to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Committing a criminal offence</li>
                    <li>Failing to comply with a legal obligation</li>
                    <li>A miscarriage of justice</li>
                    <li>Endangering the health and safety of an individual</li>
                    <li>Environmental damage</li>
                    <li>Concealing any information relating to the above</li>
                  </ul>
              <h4 id="section5.3.2">Protected disclosures</h4>
                <p>Employees are protected if they make a qualifying disclosure to a person or body specified in the legislation and under these circumstances a qualifying disclosure becomes a ‘protected disclosure’.</p>
              <h4 id="section5.3.3">Employer or responsible person</h4>
                <p>Employees are protected if they make a qualifying disclosure to their employer.</p><p>Alternatively, if an employee makes any qualifying disclosure to Public Concern at Work, an independent whistleblowing charity (0207 404 6609), the disclosure also becomes a protected disclosure.</p><p>If an employee makes a qualifying disclosure about a person who is not the employer (e.g. a supplier), or if it is about something for which a person other than the employer is responsible (e.g. a contractor), this is also a protected disclosure if it is made to that person.</p>
              <h4 id="section5.3.4">Legal advisor</h4>
                <p>A qualifying disclosure is a protected disclosure if it is made in the course of obtaining legal advice.</p>
              <h4 id="section5.3.5">Prescribed persons</h4>
                <p>A qualifying disclosure also becomes a protected disclosure if it is made directly to a person or body prescribed for that purpose. For example, a qualifying disclosure made to the Environmental Agency is only a protected disclosure if it is made in connection with acts or omission that have an actual or potential effect on the environment. If the same disclosure was made to the Civil Aviation Authority, for example, if would not be a protected disclosure.</p>
              <h4 id="section5.3.6">Disclosure in other cases</h4>
                <p>If an employee reasonably believes that:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>he will suffer a detriment if he makes a disclosure in accordance with one of the above procedures, or</li>
                    <li>there is no prescribed person and his employer may conceal or destroy evidence, or</li>
                    <li>he has already made a disclosure to the employer or a prescribed person or body</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>then a disclosure made in some other way may be a qualifying disclosure if the employee believes the information to be true, the disclosure is not made for personal gain and it is reasonable to make the disclosure.</p><p>In determining reasonableness, the following will be taken into account:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>the identity of the person to whom the disclosure was made</li>
                    <li>the seriousness of the failure</li>
                    <li>whether the failure is continuing or is likely to occur in the future</li>
                    <li>any action already taken by the employer or prescribed person</li>
                    <li>whether or not the employee made use of the employer’s nominated person</li>
                  </ul>
              <h4 id="section5.3.7">Disclosure of exceptionally serious failures</h4>
                <p>In the case of exceptionally serious failures a disclosure may be a qualifying disclosure if the employee believes the information to be true, it is not for personal gain and it is reasonable for the employee to make the disclosure.</p><p>Speed of action will often be of prime importance when there is an exceptionally serious failure. When determining reasonableness in this situation, the prime focus of attention will be on the identity of the person to whom the disclosure was made.</p>
              <h4 id="section5.3.8">Protection for whistleblowers</h4>
                <p>Those eligible for protection under the relevant legislation must not suffer any detrimental treatment as a result of raising a genuine concern. If you believe that you have suffered any such treatment you should inform your <dfn title="Manager, in this context, refers to your line manager or any member of the Senior Management Team or a Director.">Manager</dfn> immediately. If the matter is not remedied you should raise it formally using our grievance procedure.</p><p>You must not threaten or retaliate against whistleblowers in any way. If you are involved in such conduct you may be subject to disciplinary action. In some cases the whistleblower could have a right to sue you personally for compensation in an Employment Tribunal.</p><p>However, if we conclude that a whistleblower has made false allegations maliciously, the whistleblower may be subject to disciplinary action.</p>

            </header>
                <h4 id="section6.2.1">Summary</h4>
                  <p>the Company will not tolerate any form of harassment or bullying.</p><p>The purpose of this policy is to inform employees of the type of behaviour that is totally unacceptable and to explain what solutions there are to employees who may suffer harassment or bullying.</p><p>the Company intends to provide a neutral working environment in which no one feels threatened or intimidated.</p><p>Harassment is a discriminatory act and is also a criminal offence. It is very difficult to define as it can take many forms, but in the main it takes the form of unwanted behaviour by one employee towards another, for example:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Patronising or belittling comments</li>
                      <li>Comments about appearance/body/clothes</li>
                      <li>Leering or staring at a person’s body</li>
                      <li>Unwelcome sexual invitations or pressure</li>
                      <li>Promises or threats concerning employment or conditions in exchange for sexual favours</li>
                      <li>Displaying offensive or sexually explicit material</li>
                      <li>Touching, caressing, hugging or indecent assault</li>
                    </ul>
                  <aside>
                    <p>Please remember the test is that the behaviour is UNWELCOME, UNINVITED AND UNRECIPROCATED.</p>
                    <p>Bullying is also difficult to define. Obvious examples are:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Threats of or actual physical violence</li>
                        <li>Unpleasant or over repeated jokes about a person</li>
                        <li>Unfair or impractical work loading</li>
                      </ul>
                  </aside>

                <h4 id="section6.2.2">Procedure</h4>
                  <p>If you encounter a problem of this nature, it is vital that you make the person responsible aware that his/her remarks or conduct are offensive to you. This should be done in a simple, straightforward way.</p><p>It is recognised that complaints of harassment or bullying are often of a sensitive or worrying nature and that it may be difficult to speak directly to the other employee involved. If this is the case, you should put your request in writing and hand it to the harasser or bully.</p><p>When or if the informal approach fails or if you believe that the harassment or bullying is of a very serious nature you must bring the matter to the attention of a member of Management. If possible, you should keep notes of the harassment or bullying so that the formal complaint can be investigated, including the date, time and whereabouts of the act.</p><p>If you make a formal complaint it will be dealt with under the grievance procedure and all possible actions will be taken to separate you from the alleged harasser or bully.
                  </p><p>If you bring a complaint of harassment or bullying you will not be victimised for having brought the complaint. If however after a full investigation, the Company has grounds to believe that the complaint was brought with malicious intent, you will be subject to disciplinary action under the Company’s disciplinary procedure.</p><p>the Company’s appeal procedures apply to appeals against decisions made under the equal opportunities and discrimination policy and the harassment policy.</p>

                <h4 id="section6.3.1">Summary</h4>
                  <p>the Company values its reputation for ethical behaviour and for financial probity and reliability. It recognises that over and above the commission of any crime, any involvement in bribery will also reflect adversely on its image and reputation. Its aim therefore is to limit its exposure to bribery by:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>setting out a clear anti-bribery policy</li>
                      <li>establishing and implementing anti-bribery procedures as appropriate</li>
                      <li>communicating this policy and any relevant procedures to employees and to others who will perform services for the Company</li>

                      <li>monitoring and reviewing the risks and the effectiveness of any anti-bribery procedures that are in place.</li>

                <h4 id="section6.3.2">Policy</h4>
                  <p>the Company prohibits the offering, giving, solicitation or acceptance of any bribe (whether cash or other inducement):</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>to or from any person or company (wherever they are situated and whether they are a public official or body or private person or company)</li>

                      <li>in order to gain any commercial, contractual or regulatory advantage for the Company in a way that is unethical</li>
                      <li>in order to gain any personal advantage (pecuniary or otherwise) for the individual or anyone connected with the individual</li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>This policy prohibits any inducement that results in a personal gain or advantage to the recipient or any person or body associated with them, and which is intended to influence them to take action that may not be solely in the interests of the Company or of the person or body employing them or whom they represent.</p><p>This policy is not meant to prohibit normal and appropriate hospitality or the giving of a gift on a festival or at another special time, providing they are customary in a particular market, are proportionate and are properly recorded.</p><p>Inevitably, decisions as to what is acceptable may not always be easy. If you are in any doubt as to whether a potential act constitutes bribery, the matter should be referred to a Director before proceeding.</p>
                <h4 id="section6.3.3">Employees" responsibilities</h4>
                  <p>The prevention, detection and reporting of bribery is the responsibility of all employees and the Company is committed to:</p>

This means that all convictions, including those that are ‘spent’ under the terms of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 must be declared by those employees whose posts are exempt. Criminal Records Bureau checks are carried out on relevant employees at the commencement of their employment and any subsequent convictions must be notified to a member of Management. “Convictions” include convictions in a court of law, police cautions, reprimands and final warnings.</p>

                  </ul>
                <p>If compulsory redundancies are necessary, employees will be involved and consulted at various meetings to discuss selection criteria, any alternative positions, and be given every opportunity to put forward any views of their own.</p><p>the Company reserves the right to reject any voluntary applications for redundancy if it believes that the volunteer has skills and experience that need to be retained for the future viability of the business.</p>
