      <h1>Infection Control Handbook</h1>
        <h2>About this Handbook</h2>
          <aside>
            <p>Infection control is the name given to a wide range of policies, procedures and techniques intended to prevent the spread of infectious diseases amongst residents, staff or visitors and of them acquiring a healthcare-associated infection. All staff working at Birtley House are at risk of infection or of spreading infection, especially if their role brings them into contact with blood or bodily fluids such as urine, faeces, vomit or sputum. Such substances may well contain pathogens which can be spread if staff do not take adequate precautions.</p>
            <p>It is important for you to read the Handbook carefully as you are expected to comply with all the policies and procedures contained within it from time to time. These can be changed at any time by the Company and new or updated policies will be communicated to you.</p>
            <p>The information covers a wide range of subjects relating to your employment and in the event that information in this Handbook conflicts with your <dfn title="A contract is an agreement that sets out an employee’s employment conditions, rights, responsibilities and duties.  These are called the ‘terms’ of the contract">Contract of Employment</dfn>, the Contract will take precedence.<p>
            </p>If you have any questions or any part of the Handbook is unclear to you, please do not hesitate to raise any queries with your <dfn title="Manager, in this context, refers to your line manager or any member of the Senior Management Team or a Director.">Manager</dfn>.</p>
            <p>It is important that you do this before signing that you have read, understood and are willing to abide by all the Company's policies and procedures.</p>

              </header>
                  <p>Most relatives and friends appreciate the risk of spreading infection to vulnerable people. Potential visitors should be advised to telephone for advice before visiting if they have current symptoms of infection.</p>
                  <p>Visitors should be requested to help staff to keep the risk of spread of infection to a minimum and it may be helpful to display notices asking visitors who have symptoms of infection, particularly relating to respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, skin or eyes, to speak to the nurse or person in charge before seeing any residents. This applies especially to young children who are more likely to spread infection to elderly relatives.</p>
                  <p>It may be necessary for staff to explain that under certain circumstances visits should be restricted or postponed.</p>
                  <p>All visitors should be encouraged to either wash their hands or use an alcohol hand rub at the start and the end of each visit.</p>
