      <h1>Infection Control Handbook</h1>
        <h2>About this Handbook</h2>
          <aside>
            <p>Infection control is the name given to a wide range of policies, procedures and techniques intended to prevent the spread of infectious diseases amongst residents, staff or visitors and of them acquiring a healthcare-associated infection. All staff working at Birtley House are at risk of infection or of spreading infection, especially if their role brings them into contact with blood or bodily fluids such as urine, faeces, vomit or sputum. Such substances may well contain pathogens which can be spread if staff do not take adequate precautions.</p>
            <p>It is important for you to read the Handbook carefully as you are expected to comply with all the policies and procedures contained within it from time to time. These can be changed at any time by the Company and new or updated policies will be communicated to you.</p>
            <p>The information covers a wide range of subjects relating to your employment and in the event that information in this Handbook conflicts with your <dfn title="A contract is an agreement that sets out an employee’s employment conditions, rights, responsibilities and duties.  These are called the ‘terms’ of the contract">Contract of Employment</dfn>, the Contract will take precedence.<p>
            </p>If you have any questions or any part of the Handbook is unclear to you, please do not hesitate to raise any queries with your <dfn title="Manager, in this context, refers to your line manager or any member of the Senior Management Team or a Director.">Manager</dfn>.</p>
            <p>It is important that you do this before signing that you have read, understood and are willing to abide by all the Company's policies and procedures.</p>

                <h3>Effective Hand Washing</h3>
              </header>
                  <p>Birtley House believes that, consistent with modern infection control evidence and knowledge, hand washing is the single most important method of preventing the spread of infection. All staff should ensure that their hands are thoroughly washed and dried:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Between seeing each and every resident where direct contact is involved, no matter how minor the contact;</li>
                      <li>After handling any body fluids or waste or soiled items;</li>
                      <li>After handling specimens;</li>
                      <li>After using the toilet;</li>
                      <li>Before handling any food stuffs;</li>
                      <li>Before and after feeding a resident.</li>
                    </ol>
                  <p>Hands should be washed according to the guidelines posted by each sink. Liquid soaps and disposable paper towels should be used in the home rather than bar soaps and fabric towels. Antiseptic hand washing solutions (such as gels) should be used only in situations where hand washing is not possible. They are never for general use.</p>
                  <p>All cuts or abrasions, particularly on the hands, should be covered with waterproof dressings at all times.</p>
              <footer>
                  <p>Please refer to the following World Health Organisation guidance:</p>

                <h3>The Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</h3>
              </header>
                  <p>Disposable aprons and gloves are provided for all staff who are at risk of coming into direct contact with body fluids.</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Sterile gloves are provided for clinical procedures such as applying dressings. These should be worn at all times during resident contact and should be changed between residents. On no account should staff attempt to wash or reuse gloves;</li>
                      <li>Non-sterile gloves are provided for washing dirty or used instruments, cleaning up blood or bodily fluids and for handling disinfectants.</li>
                    </ol>
                  <p>Any member of staff who suspects that they or a resident might be suffering from an allergic reaction to latex gloves should stop using then immediately and inform the Manager. However, as most gloves are now non-latex these days this should not be an issue.</p>

                <h3>Cleaning of Spillages</h3>
              </header>
                  <p>All staff have a responsibility to keep the Home clean and tidy and to identify areas which fall below acceptable standards. Management of the routine cleaning of the home is the responsibility of the Housekeeping Manager.</p>
                  <p>Staff should treat every spillage of e.g. body fluids or waste as quickly as possible and as potentially infectious. They should wear protective gloves and aprons and use disposable wipes wherever possible. Eye protection should be worn if there is a risk of splashing.</p>
                  <p>For spillages of blood and or bodily fluids disinfectant granules are available to shake on to the spillage and dissolve into a gel.  Remove with the disposable scraper/scoops provided.  These   can be found in the nurse’s Clinical room. Identify the hazard and dispose of into the correct bag. Ask housekeeping to wash the floor or shampoo the carpet as appropriate. Remember to wash hands before and after cleaning the spillage.</p>

                <h3>Clinical Waste</h3>
              </header>
                <p>Clinical waste should be disposed of in sealed Yellow plastic bags and each bag should be clearly labelled with the Home’s full details (sometimes this can be an identification number only). Non-clinical waste should be disposed of in normal Black plastic bags. All yellow bags should be no more the three quarters full; these yellow bags should be sealed and stored safely to await collection by an authorised collector. Yellow bags should only be used in pedal-type bins in clinical areas. Red/Orange bags are used only to store hazardous materials.</p>
                Full bags should be stored temporarily in Sluice Rooms and removed as soon as practicable by Housekeeping staff to the Bin Compound.</p>

                <p>Typically needles, blades and broken ampoules – should be disposed of in the proper purpose built sharps disposal containers complying with BS7320. While awaiting collection they should be stored in: The yellow storage containers outside.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Staff should never re-sheath needles;</li>
                    <li>Boxes should never be filled beyond the stated lines;</li>
                    <li>When full, boxes should be sealed, marked as hazardous and clearly labelled with the Home’s details (this could be just a number);</li>
                    <li>Sharps boxes must be always placed out of the way of residents, visitors and especially any children who may be attracted by the bright colours;</li>
                    <li>Used, filled boxes should be stored securely until collection for incineration.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>In the event of injury with a used or potentially contaminated needle staff should do the following:</p>

                    <li>Report immediately to a GP, Occupational Health Department or if none are available, the Local Accident and Emergency Department.</li>

                <p>Specimens should only be collected if ordered by the resident’s GP. All specimens should be clearly labelled and packed into self-sealing bags and stored in the designated fridge prior to being taken to the GP for collection by the local laboratory. This should always be done on the same day. Non-sterile gloves should be worn when handling specimen containers and hands should be washed afterwards. All specimens should be treated with equally high levels of caution at all times.</p>

                <p>Any storage or handling of food raises a potential risk of poisoning, so the highest standards of hygiene must be observed by all staff at all times. Food stuff brought into the home by staff should be stored in the food staff fridge, never in the specimen’s fridge. Any ‘out of date’ food should be disposed of. Staff should follow all food storage recommendations and scrupulously observe sell by dates. All food kept in fridges should be correctly labelled with a three-day shelf life from opening.</p>
                <p>Any staff suffering from food poisoning, diarrhoea or vomiting should report to the home and see their GP immediately.</p>
                <p>The Duty Chef is responsible for the storage, preparation and serving of the food.</p>

              </header>
                  <p>Most relatives and friends appreciate the risk of spreading infection to vulnerable people. Potential visitors should be advised to telephone for advice before visiting if they have current symptoms of infection.</p>
                  <p>Visitors should be requested to help staff to keep the risk of spread of infection to a minimum and it may be helpful to display notices asking visitors who have symptoms of infection, particularly relating to respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, skin or eyes, to speak to the nurse or person in charge before seeing any residents. This applies especially to young children who are more likely to spread infection to elderly relatives.</p>
                  <p>It may be necessary for staff to explain that under certain circumstances visits should be restricted or postponed.</p>
                  <p>All visitors should be encouraged to either wash their hands or use an alcohol hand rub at the start and the end of each visit.</p>

                <h3>Isolation of Residents</h3>
              </header>
                  <p>This is done if/when a resident has an infectious disease and to stop the spread from one to another. This should be a single room, with hand washing facilities and where possible an en-suite lavatory and shower, for their own use. By doing this the spread should be kept to a minimum.</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>There should be a notice on the door advising “Please see Nurse before entering”. This door should be kept closed as all times;</li>
                      <li>All staff and visitors should wash hands before entering and when leaving the room;</li>
                      <li>Disposable gloves and aprons should be worn at all times during contact with the resident, especially when performing personal care needs;</li>
                      <li>All laundry should be placed into red bags and treated as contaminated;</li>
                      <li>Staff should at all times follow the guidelines set down by the Health and Safety Executive and Birtley House as to infectious diseases;</li>
                      <li>Make sure the resident and visitors, where possible, are kept up to date on why the list procedure is being followed.</li>
