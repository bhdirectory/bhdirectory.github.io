        <h2>Fire Safety Policy</h2>
        <aside>
          <p>Birtley House Group Ltd has a responsibility for ensuring the health, safety and welfare of all employees, service users and others who may have access to their workplaces. This responsibility extends to the adjoining Estate and estate facilities and the office at Birtley Courtyard. These general duties include safety in relation to fire hazards arising from the work processes and activities, as well as general fire safety in the workplace.</p>
          <p>The company has commissioned independent, comprehensive fire risk assessments which identify the main hazards of each workplace and all control measures in place.  Our fire procedures are based on the findings of these risk assessments.</p>

              <h3>Fire Action</h3>
                <aside>
                  <p>In the event of a fire, the safety of a life shall override all other considerations, such as saving property and extinguishing the fire.  The Company does not expect employees to fight fires, however, extinguishing action can be undertaken if it is safe to do so and you have been trained.  On no account should a closed room be opened to fight a fire.</p>
                </aside>
            </header>
                <p>On hearing the fire alarm:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>All staff and visitors will leave the building by the nearest available exit and proceed to the Assembly Point as identified on the Fire Action Notices.</li>
                    <li>Do not stop to collect personal belongings.</li>
                    <li>Do not re-enter the building until told to do so by the Person-in-Charge.</li>
                    <li>The Staff Nurse in the Annexe will conduct a roll call to ensure that all staff and visitors are accounted for.</li>
                    <li>The Staff Nurse in the House will determine the cause of the alarm and decide on an appropriate course of action.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>On discovery of a fire:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Immediately operate the nearest alarm call point.</li>
                    <li>Attack the fire (only if trained and if safe to do so) with the appliances provided. Do not take personal risks.</li>
                    <li>Call the Fire & Rescue Services immediately by using a phone to dial 999 and giving the operator the telephone number and asking for the fire brigade. When the fire brigade reply, give the response “We have a fire at Birtley House” and give the operator the full address including post code, from which the call is being made.  Do not replace the receiver until the fire brigade has confirmed the details. Call the fire brigade immediately to every fire or on suspicion of a fire.</li>
                    <li>Proceed to the Assembly Point to inform the Person-in-Charge.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>On notification of a fire:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The Staff Nurse in the House will take the decision to evacuate residents most at risk.</li>
                    <li>The residents most at risk will be determined by the location and scale of the fire and the PEEPs of individual residents.</li>
                    <li>The Staff Nurse in the House will allocate staff to assist residents accordingly.</li>
                    <li>The ability to conduct an evacuation will be determined largely by the number of staff available.</li>
                    <li>If not involved directly in evacuating residents, due to sufficient numbers of staff, the Staff Nurse in the Annexe will ensure that:
                      <ol>
                        <li>the emergency services are updated on the decision to begin an evacuation;</li>
                        <li>that entrance gates to the property are open;</li>
                        <li>that supplies of electricity and gas are shut off at the incoming supply.</li>
                      </ol>

              <h3>Evacuation Strategy</h3>
                <aside>
                  <p>Our evacuation strategy is one of progressive horizontal evacuation , whereby residents can be moved away from any fire to adjoining Protected Areas where they can remain for a time in reasonable safety.</p>
                </aside>
            </header>
                <h4>Protected Areas arrangement</h4>
                  <p>In order to achieve this, the parts of the building used for sleeping accommodation are divided into sub compartments designated as Protected Areas.  These are separated from each other by walls and doors that provide fire resistance and are of sufficient capacity to accommodate the likely number of residents who may have to be moved from an adjoining area.</p>
                  <p>The aim is to evacuate all residents from a protected area to a place of reasonable safety within 2½ minutes of the alarm being raised.  In our high risk environment, with mixed mobility levels and taking into account night-time staffing levels, the need to extend this escape time is unavoidable.</p>
                  <p>Plans of the Protected Areas are available:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><a href="protectedAreas-groundFloor.pdf">Ground Floor</a></li>
                      <li><a href="protectedAreas-firstFloor.pdf">First & Second Floors</a></li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEPs)</h4>
                  <p>The residents’ PEEPs and associated staff training is designed to minimize the time spent planning an evacuation and maximize the time available to assist residents.</p>
                  <p>The PEEP pre-determines the shortest route from the resident’s room to an adjoining Protected Area and to an alternative Protected Area.  The second part, completed by a nurse in conjunction with the resident and any stakeholders, assesses the level of support that the resident would require to reach the Protected Areas by categorizing the resident into one of four mobility bands.  The document forms part of the Resident’s Care Plan and a copy kept in the Emergency Bag in the Front Entrance Hall.</p>
                  <p>PEEP form templates are avilable for each residential room:<p>

                <h4>Staffing levels</h4>
                  <p>The ability to conduct an effective evacuation is largely dependant on the number of staff available.  Planning and training assumes the lowest ratio of staff to residents and reflects the current night-time staffing levels.</p>
                <h4>Inclement weather considerations</h4>
                  <p>In the event of an evacuation during inclement weather, the escape of residents through final exit doors needs to be carefully considered.  In these conditions, where possible, residents should be moved to adjoining areas of safety within the building.</p>
                <h4>Post incident arrangements</h4>
                  <p>Following any incident that involves the evacuation of areas of the building, the relevant part of the Business Continuity Plan should be put into effect.  This considers alternative accommodation for residents and additional notifications that must be	made.</p>
