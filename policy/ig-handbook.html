          <h2>Data Protection Policy</h2>
            <aside>
              <p>The <i>General Data Protection Regulation</i> (GDPR) which came into force in May 2018, strengthened your rights over any personal data that the Company holds on you.

              <p>This policy is underpinned by the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="#policyDataSecurity">Data Security Policy</a> – details the management of records from creation to disposal.  The policy outlines the measures that are taken to safeguard personal information and includes procedures for the ensuring compliance with payment card security standards and the reporting of any data security breach;</li>
                  <li><a href="#policyNetworkSecurity">Network Security Policy</a> – outlines procedures for securing our network and associated IT equipment including procedures in the event of a security failure or disaster affecting digital systems or mass loss of hardcopy information necessary to the day to day running of our organisation;</li>
                  <li>A <a href="#confidentialityCode">Confidentiality Code of Conduct</a> - which provides Staff with clear guidance on the disclosure of personal information.</li>

                    <p>As defined in the GDPR (2016), the <i>Data Controller</i> is:</p>
                    <blockquote>the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.</blockquote>
                  </aside>
              </header>
                <p>The Company is both a <i>Data Controller</i> and a <i>Data Processor</i> and is appropriately registered with the <a href="">Information Commissioner's Office</a> (ICO), the UK authority for data protection.</p>
                <p>We process the personal information of our staff and clients including special categories of data such as healthcare records and criminal records.  This policy includes in its scope all data which we process either in hardcopy or electronic format.  We also process CCTV images.</p>
                <p>This policy applies to all staff, including temporary staff, our service users and third-party service providers.</p>

                  <aside>
                    <p>We will be open and transparent with residents and those who lawfully act on their behalf in relation to their care and treatment. We will adhere to our <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-providers/regulations-enforcement/regulation-20-duty-candour">Duty of Candour</a> responsibilities as outlined in the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/7/contents">Health and Social Care Act 2012</a>.</p>
                    <p>We will establish and maintain policies to ensure compliance and maintain policies for the controlled and appropriate sharing of Resident and Staff information within the organisation and with other agencies, taking account all relevant legislation and consent.</p>
                    <p>We will undertake annual audits of our compliance with legal requirements.</p>
                    <p>We acknowledge our accountability in ensuring that personal data shall be:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner (see our <a href="#privacyNotice">Privacy Notice</a>);</li>
                        <li>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes (see <a href="#dp-lawfulBases">Our Lawful Bases for Processing Data</a>);</li>
                        <li>adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed and is kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed (see the principle of <a href="#dp-byDesignAndByDefault">Data Protection by Design and by Default</a>);</li>
                        <li>accurate and kept up to date (see our <a href="#dp-dataQuality">Data Quality Principles</a>);</li>
                        <li>processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data (see our <a href="#policyDataSecurity">Data Security Policy)</a>.</li>
                      </ul>
                    <p>We uphold the personal data rights outlined in the GDPR and as set out in our <a href="#dataRights">Your Data Rights</a>:</p>

                <h4 id="dp-byDesignAndByDefault">Data Protection by Design and by Default</h4>
                  <p>We shall implement appropriate organisational and technical measures to uphold the principles outlined above. We will integrate necessary safeguards to any data processing to meet regulatory requirements and to protect individual’s data rights. This implementation will consider the nature, scope, purpose and context of any processing and the risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals caused by the processing.</p>
                  <p>We shall uphold the principles of <i>Data Protection by Design and by Default</i> from the beginning of any data processing and during the planning and implementation of any new data process.</p>
                  <p>Any new high-risk data processing activities will be assessed using a <i>Data Protection Impact Assessment</i> (DPIA) before the processing commences.</p>
                  <p>All existing data processing has been recorded on our <i>Information Asset Register</i> (IAR). Each process has been risk assessed and is reviewed annually.</p>
                  <p>We ensure that, by default, personal data is only processed when necessary for specific purposes and that individuals are therefore protected against privacy risks.</p>
                  <p>In all processing of personal data, we use the least amount of identifiable data necessary to complete the work it is required for and we only keep the information for as long as it is required for the purposes of processing or any other legal requirement to retain it.</p>

                <h4 id="dp-dataQuality">Data Quality Principles</h4>
                  <aside>
                    <p>We commit to ensuring that we comply with the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014: Regulation 17(c) that we will<blockquote cite="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2014/9780111117613/part/3/crossheading/fundamental-standards">...maintain securely an accurate, complete and contemporaneous record in respect of each service user, including a record of the care and treatment provided to the service user and of decisions taken in relation to the care and treatment provided.</blockquote></p>
                    <p>The Company acknowledges that the availability of accurate and timely data is vital for the safety of our residents and Staff and the safe and responsible running of our organisation.</p>
                  </aside>
                    <p>We ensure accuracy in our data in both hardcopy and electronic records by making sure all data has the following characteristics:
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Authentic</strong> – the data is what is claims to be, has been created or sent by the person who said that they created or sent it, and that this was done at the time claimed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reliable</strong> – the data is complete, accurate, has been created close to the time of the activity it records, and has been created by individuals with direct knowledge of the event it records.</li>
                        <li><strong>Integrity</strong> – the data is complete and unaltered, it is also protected from being changed or altered by unauthorised persons, any alterations are clearly marked and the person who made them can be identified.</li>
                        <li><strong>Useable</strong> – the data can be located when it is required for use and its context is clear in a contemporaneous record.</li>
                      </ul>
                    <p>The principal purpose of our residents records is to record and communicate information about the individual and their care. The principal purpose of staff records is to record employment details for payroll and business planning purposes.  To fulfil these purposes, we:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Use standardised structures and layouts for the contents of records as far as possible;</li>
                        <li>Ensure documentation reflects the continuum of care, that all care is person centred and that care records are viewable in chronological order;</li>
                        <li>Provide a clearly written care plan when care is being delivered by several members of the team, and we ensure that records are maintained and updated, and shared with everyone involved;</li>
                        <li>Train staff on the creation and use of records and provide training on good record keeping;</li>
                        <li>Have implemented a procedure that enables residents and staff to have access to their records as outlined in the <a href="#dq-subjectAccessRequest"><i>Subject Access Request</i></a> procedure.</li>
                      </ul>
                    <p>The <i>Registered Manager</i> is responsible for the quality of records and making sure that staff understand their commitments in ensuring data quality;</p>
                    <p>Every member of staff who records information - whether hardcopy or electronic - has a contractual responsibility to ensure that the data is accurate and as complete as possible. This responsibility extends to any system the staff member has access to.</p>

                <h3>Our Lawful Bases for Processing Data</h3>
                  <aside>
                    <p>The <i>General Data Protection Regulation</i> (GDPR) establishes 6 legal bases on which we can process your data: <i>Consent</i>, <i>Contract</i>, <i>Legal Obligation</i>, <i>Vital Interests</i>, <i>Public Task</i> and <i>Legitimate Interest</i>. For further information about these legal bases and fuller definitions, please refer to the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/">ICO website</a></p>
                  </aside>
                    <p>The Company will keep a record of the basis on which we are relying for each processing purpose as part of our <i>Information Asset Register</i> (IAR) and include details about the lawful bases under which we process data via our <i>Privacy Notice</i> and other publically available documents.</p>
                    <p>The Company has identified how the following <strong>Article 6</strong> conditions for lawful processing are relevant to our activities:</p>
              </header>
                  <h4 id="lawfulBasis-consent">6(1)(a) Consent</h4>
                      <p>Where consent is deemed the most appropriate basis for processing data, the Company will ensure that informed and explicit consent will be obtained and documented in clear, accessible language and in an appropriate format. The individual can withdraw this consent at any time through processes which will have been explained to them.  We will ensure that it is as easy to withdraw as to give consent.</p>

                  <h4 id="lawfulBasis-contract">6(1)(b) Contract</h4>
                      <p>In general, our lawful basis for the majority of our processing of personal information is in order to fulfil our contractual obligations to both staff and service users.  Processing under this basis must be necessary to fulfill a contractual obligation.  Where this data is considered <i>Special Category Data</i>, a separate condition will also be required (see below: <a href="#specialCategoryData">Special Category Data</a>).</p>

                  <h4 id="lawfulBasis-legalObligation">6(1)(c) Legal Obligation</h4>
                      <p>Where the Company is obliged to process personal data in order to comply with the law and the process is reasonable and proportionate in achieving compliance.  Where there is a <i>Legal Obligation</i>, the law in question will be cited in the <i>Information Asset Register</i>.  Under this basis, the data subject will have no <i>Right to Erasure</i>, <i>Right to Data Portability</i>, or <i>Right to Object</i> to the processing.</p>

                  <h4 id="lawfulBasis-publicTask">6(1)(e) Public Task</h4>
                      <p>In exceptional circumstances, the Company may be compelled to act to protect an individual at risk of harm or if we believe an individual is a risk to themselves or others.  In such cases, we may share personal information we hold with the police or other agencies under this basis.  Under this basis, the data subject will have no <i>Right to Erasure</i> or <i>Right to Data Portability</i>, but would have a <i>Right to Object</i> to the processing.</p>

                  <h4 id="lawfulBasis-legitimateInterest">6(1)(f) Legitimate Interest</h4>
                      <p>In general, the Company will only process personal data under a legitimate interest basis if this is in a manner that the data subject would expect and where there is only a minimal privacy impact.  In these instances, the Company would always consider whether it can offer a means of opting out.</p>

                  <h4 id="specialCategoryData">Special Category Data</h4>
                      <p>Special Category Data is personal information that the GDPR considers more sensitive and requires further protection.  In order to lawfully process <i>Special Category Data</i>, the Company will identify both a lawful basis under Article 6 and a separate condition for processing <i>Special Category Data</i> under Article 9.</p>
                      <p>The condition for processing <i>Special Category Data</i> which most commonly applies to us is Article 9(2)(h):</p>
                      <blockquote>...the provision of health or social care or treatment...</blockquote>
                  <h4 id="criminalOffenceData">Criminal Offence Data</h4>
                      <p>Just as with <i>Special Category Data</i>, the Company must have a lawful basis under Article 6 to process <i>Criminal Offence Data</i>, however there are separate safeguards for protecting personal information relating to criminal convictions or offences which require compliance with Article 10.  The Company has legal authority to carry out DBS checks on all staff and others likely to have direct contact with our service users.  The Company will not keep a comprehensive register of criminal convictions.</p>

                      <p>In certain circumstances, you may be able to request that the personal data we are processing be restricted.  In these circumstances, we may hold your data, but not use it.</p>
                      <p>You have the right to request we restrict the processing of your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>you contest the accuracy of the personal data we hold on you and you are verifying the accuracy of the data;</li>

                    <p>The <i>Right to Data Portability</i> is intended to allow individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services.  However, due to the fact that we do not process personal information by automated means, the Company deems this right not applicable to those within the scope of this policy at this time.</p>

                  <h4 id="rightToObject">Right to Object</h4>
                    <p>Article 21 of the GDPR gives individuals the <i>Right to Object</i> to the processing of their personal data. This effectively allows individuals to ask you to stop processing their personal data. The <i>Right to Object</i> only applies in certain circumstances. Whether it applies depends on your purposes for processing and your lawful basis for processing.</p>
                    <p>You always have the <i>Right to Object</i> to any direct marketing we conduct, although we would only carry our direct marketing where we have sought your <i>Consent</i> through an 'opt-in' process and provided you with a straightforward means of withdrawing your <i>Consent</i> at any time.</p>
                    <p>Any objections for processing which we do on the basis of <i>Legitimate Interests</i> or <i>Public Task</i> must be specific to the situation.  We would need to demonstrate a compelling reason why our interests outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms if we were not to uphold your objection.</p>
                    <p>Any requests made in this regard will be treated in line with our <a href="standardProcedures-handlingRequests">Standard Procedures for Handling Requests</a>.</p>

            <aside>
              <p>Article 5(1)(f) of the <i>General Data Protection Regulation</i> (GDPR) concerns the ‘integrity and confidentiality’ of personal data. It says that personal data shall be:</p>
                <blockquote>Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures</blockquote>
              <p>Our Data Security Policy sets out procedures that ensure:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the safekeeping of all records from their creation to disposal;</li>
                  <li>the safe sharing of information externally when there is a legal basis to do so;</li>
                  <li>personal information is protected and that it is not disclosed inappropriately, either by accident or design, whilst in use or when it is being transferred;</li>
                  <li>all records are retained and destroyed in-line with the <a href="#rm-retentionAndDisposal">Retention & Disposal Procedures</a>.</li>
                  <li>preserve the confidentiality and accuracy of all electronic assets;</li>
                  <li>protect those assets against unauthorised disclosure.</li>

                      <blockquote>Only those individuals who need access to personal confidential data should have access to it, and they should only have access to the data items that they need to see.  This may mean introducing access controls or splitting data flows where one data flow is used for several purposes.</blockquote>

                    <p>Physical access to records shall only be granted on a strict ‘need to know’ basis.

                    <p>During their induction each staff member who requires access to confidential information for their job role will be trained on the safe handling of all information and will be taught the procedures which govern how data is used, stored, shared and organised in our organisation.</p>
                    <p>Staff must retain personal and confidential information and data securely in locked storage when not in use, and keys should not be left in the barrels of filing cabinets and doors.</p>

                    <p>We will ensure that all confidential information that we transfer by post or courier is done so as securely as is practicable. All records transferred in this manner are addressed to a named individual and marked “Private and Confidential”. All records which are posted will be done through signed-for delivery so that it is guaranteed that the correct person receives the record.</p>

                  <h4 id="faxes">Faxes</h4>
                    <p>The fax machine is located in the Admin Office.  To ensure that confidential information transferred by fax is done so as securely as is practicable, we ensure that:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>the fax number is always double checked, and frequently used numbers are stored in the fax machine to reduce the risk of typing errors;</li>
                        <li>a fax cover sheet is used and marked "Private and Confidential";</li>
                        <li>faxes are only sent to a named person rather than a team;</li>
                        <li>the recipient is informed that a fax will be sent, and asked to confirm receipt;</li>
                        <li>faxes are not sent outside a recipient organisation's working hours where there is no-one present to receive;</li>
                        <li>we regularly check the date and time, especially following power outages, or change of British summer time;</li>
                        <li>logs are retained in line with our retention schedule;</li>
                      </ul>
                    <p>For improved data security, the use of faxes will be replaced by encrypted email (see <a href="#email">Email</a>).</p>

                  <h4 id="email">Email</h4>
                    <p>The Company does not currently have access to secure email, until such time, the procedure is to never send or receive sensitive personal information via email.</p>
                    <p>It is the intention of the Company to apply for access to the <i>NHSMail</i> system which will allow secure transfer of information via this medium.  The policy will be updated once this is in place</p>
                    <p>Before sending any email containing confidential information:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>consider whether this is the most appropriate form of distribution;</li>
                        <li>check the content for accuracy and to ensure it is up-to-date and relevant;</li>
                        <li>check recipient address(es) for accuracy to ensure that the email is not sent to the wrong person;</li>
                        <li>consider whether any recipients on the distribution list may not expect their email addresses to be shared with others;</li>
                        <li>consider encrypting any attachments where resources of both sender and receiver allow;</li>
                        <li>ensure that you use the email signature that has been provided and approved by the Company, including the Company’s legal disclaimer for emails.</li>
                      </ul>
                    <p>Whilst the Company takes strict measures to prevent incoming ‘spam’ emails, it is inevitable that some will find their way to inboxes. Unsolicited emails from unknown sources should be treated with suspicion. In such emails, never click any links nor open attachments. If you have an unusually high number of such emails, please contact the <i>IG Lead</i>.</p>
                    <p>Just as the use of the postal address of the Company should not be used for personal deliveries, so a Company email address should not be used to receive personal emails. However, if an email of a non-work-related nature is received, on no account should the email be forwarded to others.  The use of a company email address to register for any personal online account or nonbusiness-related services is also forbidden.</p>

                  <h4>Web-based Upload</h4>
                    <p>Use of cloud-based software.  Specific guidance is provided by the software provider and training will be given as necessary.  Examples currently in use include:</p>

                  <h3>Card Payments (PCI DSS Compliance)</h3>
                    <aside>
                      <p>Compliance with <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</a> (PCI DSS) is mandatory for any company that stores, processes, or transmits payment cardholder data.  The Company does not store or transmit payment card data but does process card payments which are subsequently handled by an external service provider who is certified as being <i>PCI DSS</i> compliant.</p>
                    </aside>
                </header>
                  <h4>Arrangements</h4>
                    <p>A <i>Cardholder Data Environment</i> (CDE) has been defined.  The storage, operation and  maintenance of any equipment used to process card payments is restricted to this area only.  The processing of card payments is only done by authorised employees who have had specific instruction in this regard.  A register of these employees is maintained.</p>

                  <h4>Responsibilities</h4>
                      <ul>

                        <li>No sensitive data relating to card payments is to be stored on computers.  If it is necessary to physically record the cardholder’s name, Primary Account Number(PAN), the expiry date of the card or service code, this must be done so on paper and must be kept locked away and shredded at the first convenient opportunity;</li>
                        <li>The Card Verification Number should not be physically recorded under any circumstances;</li>
                        <li>All merchant copies of receipts must have the PAN masked;</li>
                        <li>All sensitive data is shredded either directly or using the locked confidential waste bins;</li>
                        <li>Privately-owned computers and other equipment (including mobile telephones, laptop computers and tablets) must not be used for the processing, storage or transmission of any cardholder data associated with any aspect of the business;</li>
                        <li>There must be no distribution of any media used to record cardholder data outside of the <i>CDE</i>;</li>
                        <li>Cameras, mobile telephones (incorporating cameras) and visual, and audio recording devices must not be used in the <i>CDE</i>.</li>

                <p>In order to gain access to the network, <i>Registered Users</i> will be authenticated by a secure log-on credentials, designed to minimise the opportunity for unauthorised access.  Remote access to the network is strictly limited to essential users and administrators only and is also password protected.<p>

                <p>Where software and systems allow, the Company will ensure that each user is identified by a unique user ID so that users can be linked to and be accountable for their actions.  A record is kept of all users given access to the Company Network and its system.</p>
                <p>The use of group IDs is only permitted where they are suitable for the work carried out (such as in the case of departmental email accounts).</p>

                <p>The <i>IG Lead</i> will ensure that:
                  <ul>
                    <li>all users of the network are provided with the necessary security guidance, awareness and where appropriate training to discharge their security responsibilities;</li>
                    <li>access rights to the network will be allocated on the requirements of the user's job, rather than on a status basis.</li>
                    <li>only <i>Registered Users</i> are able to access the network and are de-registered when access is no longer required;</li>
                    <li>user access rights will be immediately removed or reviewed for those users who have left the Company or if their role changes.</li>
                    <li>security privileges (i.e. "superuser" or network administrator rights) to the network will be allocated on the requirements of the user's job, rather than on a status basis.</li>
                    <li>good password management practices are followed;</li>
                    <li>other than through a formal contract with a company providing IT support, all third-party access to the network is only granted in exceptional circumstances in order to provide a beneficial service.</li>
                    <li>there is a regular review of all access rights, at least once a year. The review is designed to positively confirm all system users. Any lapsed or unwanted logons which are identified are disabled immediately and deleted unless positively reconfirmed.</li>

                        <p>In order to make a <i>Subject Access Request</i>, you (or in some cases your legal representative), should contact the <i>IG Lead</i>.</p>
                      <h4>ID checks</h4>

                      <h4>Receiving your information</h4>
                        We will provide a copy of any information which it is lawful to provide free of charge. If further copies are required, we will charge a fee which will exclusively cover the administration costs of making copies.

                    <h3>Electronic Communications - Acceptable Use Policy</h3>
                  </header>
                    <h4>Scope</h4>
                      <p>This policy covers the use of all forms of electronic communication including email, fax or telephone calls, social media, SMS (text messaging) or any form of voice or video transmissions either live or recorded.</p>
                    <h4>Etiquette</h4>
                      <p>employees should consider all communications made from Company assets or using Company networks, including anything uploaded to the internet which makes reference to Company business, as Company property.</p>
                      <p>Electronic communication should not be used as a substitute for face to face or telephone conversations or meetings.</p>
                      <p>All electronic communications should be clear and unambiguous and used primarily to distribute/update information, confirm arrangements, confirm meetings etc.</p>
                      <p>It must not be used for purposes outside of the job role or for any personal reasons.</p>
                      <p>Email should be treated as if it were a hard copy letter and drafted and checked in the same way. The Company will value an email message the same as a hard copy letter.</p>
                      <p>All communications must adhere to the principles set out in the Company’s <a href="#policyDataProtection">Data Protection Policy</a>. Where confidential information is being sent, either directly or via attachments in email or hyperlinks, appropriate controls must be used to ensure that this information is not at risk of a breach.</p>
                      <p>The same standards of behaviour are expected in electronic communication as apply to verbal communication in the workplace.  No email message or response to an email should be sent in haste, anger or hostility. Ideally a time for consideration should elapse between drafting and sending a reply. Email messages should be checked after drafting for clarity, accuracy of message and absence of words which could be abusive, emotive, etc. The language used must be consistent with conventional standards, decency and respect for others and good manners.  Commenting on or about another person should be avoided but, if it is unavoidable, should only be based on and backed up by facts. On no account must any Company communication system or any social media platform be used for vindictive, harassing, discriminatory or abusive comment or criticism of anyone, whether this is to target the Company, another employee or any third-party. Furthermore, it may not be used for electronic stalking.  Words in capital letters could be considered shouting. The use of exclamation marks, humour and sarcasm can be especially problematic in emails and should be used with caution. Please consider the ‘tone’ of your message in the same way you would speak to someone face to face.
                      </p>
                      <p>employees using any public digital platform outside of work must ensure that they do not make any reference to the Home by name or in photographs, or to any employee, resident or any other person connected with the company other than in an entirely positive manner.</p>
                    <h4>Disciplinary Action</h4>
                      <p>Company websites and social media sites are the sole property of the Company and any unauthorised interference with or copying and variation of such websites is not only gross misconduct but also can generate an action for damages.  A person receiving an email which they feel contravenes these rules should notify their line manager immediately. On no account should such concerns, which may become subject to an investigation, be discussed with other employees as this would be viewed as gossip and subject to the relevant policy and disciplinary action.  Any person proved to have deliberately used email in a way that contravenes the policy will be deemed guilty of gross misconduct and will be subject to disciplinary procedures.  Failure to comply with any aspect of this policy will be treated as a serious breach of the rules and will result in disciplinary action.</p>
