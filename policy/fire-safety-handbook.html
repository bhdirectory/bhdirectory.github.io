        <header>
          <h2>About this Handbook</h2>
          <aside>
            <p>This Handbook has been drawn up by the <dfn title="The Company refers to Birtley House Group Ltd or its subsidiary companies, Eyhurst Court Ltd and Birtley Mews Ltd.">Company</dfn> in order to bring together a closely related range of policies and procedures which govern an open and transparent approach to care and reflect a commitment to the safety and wellbeing of all our residents, staff and visitors to Birtley House.</p>
            <p>Birtley House is committed to effective governance and improving standards in all the services it offers.  In order to achieve this, the company will continually evaluate its practice through good record keeping, auditing and reviews as per <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-providers/regulations-enforcement/regulation-17-good-governance#guidance-links">Regulation 17 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014</a>.</p>
            <p>As part of our good governance practice, we will seek feedback from people using our service, those acting on their behalf, staff and other stakeholders on a regular basis.  The results of these surveys and any reviews that take place will be openly shared with those concerned and, wherever possible, they will be involved in decisions that affect their lives.</p>
            <p>Through our Registered Manager and Nominated Individual, we maintain close and regular communication with our CQC inspector and provide written reports when requested.  Any recommendations made by the regulator to the service will be acted on without delay.  Nationally recognised guidance and best practice will be implemented as far as practicable and changes to such quality and safety standards will be monitored.  The Board of Directors has an overall responsibility for the effective running of the Home and receives monthly reports from the Registered Manager.</p>
            <p>As someone who works at Birtley House, it is important for you to read the Handbook carefully as you are expected to comply with all the policies and procedures contained within it from time to time. These can be changed at any time by the Company and new or updated policies will be communicated to you.</p>
            <p>The information covers a wide range of subjects relating to your employment and in the event that information in this Handbook conflicts with your <dfn title="A contract is an agreement that sets out an employee’s employment conditions, rights, responsibilities and duties.  These are called the ‘terms’ of the contract">Contract of Employment</dfn>, the Contract will take precedence.<p>
            </p>If you have any questions or any part of the Handbook is unclear to you, please do not hesitate to raise any queries with your <dfn title="Manager, in this context, refers to your line manager or any member of the Senior Management Team or a Director.">Manager</dfn>.</p>
            <p>It is important that you do this before signing that you have read, understood and are willing to abide by all the Company's policies and procedures.</p>

              <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                <aside>

                  <p>Overall responsibility for Fire Safety at Birtley House lies with the Provider, who ensure the right level of scrutiny and oversight are given and are responsible for ensuring that all related policies and procedures are regularly reviewed and communicated to all staff and volunteers.</p>

              <h3>Fire Action</h3>
                <aside>
                  <p>In the event of a fire, the safety of a life shall override all other considerations, such as saving property and extinguishing the fire.  The Company does not expect employees to fight fires, however, extinguishing action can be undertaken if it is safe to do so and you have been trained.  On no account should a closed room be opened to fight a fire.</p>
                </aside>
            </header>
                <p>On hearing the fire alarm:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>All staff and visitors will leave the building by the nearest available exit and proceed to the Assembly Point as identified on the Fire Action Notices.</li>
                    <li>Do not stop to collect personal belongings.</li>
                    <li>Do not re-enter the building until told to do so by the Person-in-Charge.</li>
                    <li>The Staff Nurse in the Annexe will conduct a roll call to ensure that all staff and visitors are accounted for.</li>
                    <li>The Staff Nurse in the House will determine the cause of the alarm and decide on an appropriate course of action.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>On discovery of a fire:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Immediately operate the nearest alarm call point.</li>
                    <li>Attack the fire (only if trained and if safe to do so) with the appliances provided. Do not take personal risks.</li>
                    <li>Call the Fire & Rescue Services immediately by using a phone to dial 999 and giving the operator the telephone number and asking for the fire brigade. When the fire brigade reply, give the response “We have a fire at Birtley House” and give the operator the full address including post code, from which the call is being made.  Do not replace the receiver until the fire brigade has confirmed the details. Call the fire brigade immediately to every fire or on suspicion of a fire.</li>
                    <li>Proceed to the Assembly Point to inform the Person-in-Charge.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>On notification of a fire:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The Staff Nurse in the House will take the decision to evacuate residents most at risk.</li>
                    <li>The residents most at risk will be determined by the location and scale of the fire and the PEEPs of individual residents.</li>
                    <li>The Staff Nurse in the House will allocate staff to assist residents accordingly.</li>
                    <li>The ability to conduct an evacuation will be determined largely by the number of staff available.</li>
                    <li>If not involved directly in evacuating residents, due to sufficient numbers of staff, the Staff Nurse in the Annexe will ensure that:
                      <ol>
                        <li>the emergency services are updated on the decision to begin an evacuation;</li>
                        <li>that entrance gates to the property are open;</li>
                        <li>that supplies of electricity and gas are shut off at the incoming supply.</li>
                      </ol>
                    </li>
