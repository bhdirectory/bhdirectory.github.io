<h4>INTRO</h4>
<p>Hi, I'm Tim Whalley, Director and Nominated Individual for Birtley House Nursing Home and I'm delighted to welcome you onto our team.
In this five part health and safety induction, we will consider aspects of fire safety and security, our welfare facilities for staff, responsibilities around the protection of personal information in the business.  As someone working at Birtley House, you have a responsibility to understand our local policies and procedures.  The final part of this series explains where you can find Company policies and additional materials to help you fulfil that obligation and develop your own skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>Each of the four videos that make up this series can be viewed separately to aid future reference and bite-sized learning.  The script of the videos can be found on our website.</p>

<h3>PART 1 - Fire Safety</h3>
<aside>
<p>In this part of the Birtley House health and safety induction, we will be looking at the procedures and equipment that ensure that the risk of fire in the nursing home is minimised and staff are prepared for any evacuation that may have to take place.</p>
<ol>
<li>Birtley House has an automatic fire detection system designed and maintained to an L1 standard which recognises the risk to life should a fire occur.</li>
<li>The fabric of the building is designed to withstand the spread of fire for a minimum of 30 minutes, with automatically-closing fire doors on every residential room.</li>
<li>We operate a delayed evacuation procedure for residents to ensure that, should a fire occur, able-bodied staff can prioritise the safety of residents most at risk.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's look at how this is achieved...</p>
</aside>


<h4>Automatic Fire Detection System</h4>
<p>The fire panel is located in the Front Entrance Hall, immediately inside the Front Door.  The duty nurses and other staff with responsibilities in the event of a fire would consult this panel to determine where the detection has occured.  The alarm system is addressable which means that each individual detector point can be identified and the location of the detection can be accurately identified.  The alarm system is tested on a weekly basis, usually on a Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<h4>Preventing the spread of fire</h4>
<p>Each residential room offers a minimum of 30 minutes fire protection.  The doors to each room are fitted with automatic closers to allow residents to keep their doors open whilst remaining compliant with fire regulations.  The function of these doors are tested as part of the weekly alarm test.  In addition, smoke seals and an intumescent strip are present on each door to further protect the resident in the event of a actual fire in the proximity of the room.</p>

<h4>Fire Action Procedures</h4>
<p>In the event of hearing a fire alarm, staff should follow the Fire Actions as specified on notices around the building.  In the event of an actual fire being confirmed, additional fire action procedures will be initiated by the duty nurses.  All staff, having evacuated to the Assembly Point, should await further instruction from those with responsibilities.  Residents deemed to be most at risk from a fire will be evacuated according to their Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans in line with our strategy of a staged, horizontal evacuation.</p>

<h4>Evacuation Procedures</h4>
<p>The principle of a staged horizontal evacuation is to move residents at risk from fire behind a minimum of two fire doors.  The staged approach allows a greater number of residents to be moved to a safe distance in the shortest possible time.  Where possible, evacuations will avoid using stairs in order to save time and reduce the risk of injuries. Where a vertical evacuation is necessary, staff who have undergone the appropriate training will be asked to assist.  In all emergency situations, we ask that staff follow the instructions of senior staff with responsibilities.</p>
