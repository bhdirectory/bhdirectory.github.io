<h4>INTRO</h4>
<p>Hi, I'm Tim Whalley, Director and Nominated Individual for Birtley House Nursing Home and I'm delighted to welcome you onto our team.
In this five part health and safety induction, we will consider aspects of fire safety and security, our welfare facilities for staff, responsibilities around the protection of personal information in the business.  As someone working at Birtley House, you have a responsibility to understand our local policies and procedures.  The final part of this series explains where you can find Company policies and additional materials to help you fulfil that obligation and develop your own skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>Each of the four videos that make up this series can be viewed separately to aid future reference and bite-sized learning.  The script of the videos can be found on our website.</p>

<h3>PART 1 - Fire Safety</h3>
<aside>
<p>In this part of the Birtley House health and safety induction, we will be looking at the procedures and equipment that ensure that the risk of fire in the nursing home is minimised and staff are prepared for any evacuation that may have to take place.</p>
<ol>
<li>Birtley House has an automatic fire detection system designed and maintained to an L1 standard which recognises the risk to life should a fire occur.</li>
<li>The fabric of the building is designed to withstand the spread of fire for a minimum of 30 minutes, with automatically-closing fire doors on every residential room.</li>
<li>We operate a delayed evacuation procedure for residents to ensure that, should a fire occur, able-bodied staff can prioritise the safety of residents most at risk.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's look at how this is achieved...</p>
</aside>


<h4>Automatic Fire Detection System</h4>
<p>The fire panel is located in the Front Entrance Hall, immediately inside the Front Door.  The duty nurses and other staff with responsibilities in the event of a fire would consult this panel to determine where the detection has occured.  The alarm system is addressable which means that each individual detector point can be identified and the location of the detection can be accurately identified.  The alarm system is tested on a weekly basis, usually on a Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<h4>Preventing the spread of fire</h4>
<p>Each residential room offers a minimum of 30 minutes fire protection.  The doors to each room are fitted with automatic closers to allow residents to keep their doors open whilst remaining compliant with fire regulations.  The function of these doors are tested as part of the weekly alarm test.  In addition, smoke seals and an intumescent strip are present on each door to further protect the resident in the event of a actual fire in the proximity of the room.</p>

<h4>Fire Action Procedures</h4>
<p>In the event of hearing a fire alarm, staff should follow the Fire Actions as specified on notices around the building.  In the event of an actual fire being confirmed, additional fire action procedures will be initiated by the duty nurses.  All staff, having evacuated to the Assembly Point, should await further instruction from those with responsibilities.  Residents deemed to be most at risk from a fire will be evacuated according to their Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans in line with our strategy of a staged, horizontal evacuation.</p>

<h4>Evacuation Procedures</h4>
<p>The principle of a staged horizontal evacuation is to move residents at risk from fire behind a minimum of two fire doors.  The staged approach allows a greater number of residents to be moved to a safe distance in the shortest possible time.  Where possible, evacuations will avoid using stairs in order to save time and reduce the risk of injuries. Where a vertical evacuation is necessary, staff who have undergone the appropriate training will be asked to assist.  In all emergency situations, we ask that staff follow the instructions of senior staff with responsibilities.</p>

  <h3>PART 2 - Security</h3>
<aside>
<p>In this part of the Birtley House health and safety induction, we will be looking at the security procedures and equipment that ensure that the risk of unauthorised entry, theft, vandalism or exposure to dangerous equipment on the property is minimised and staff are aware of their responsibilities in this regard.</p>
<ol>
<li>Birtley House has physical access control on all external doors, certain internal doors and on other doors that contain confidential information, high value items or potentially dangerous equipment.</li>
<li>Locking-up procedures are in place to ensure that the physical controls are effective.</li>
<li>Staff with responsibilities are aware of how to contact the emergency services and/or other resources in the event of a security breach.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's look at how this is achieved...</p>
</aside>
<h4>Access Control</h4>
<p>Throughout the building there are doors which are required to be locked in order to restrict access to authorised members of staff and contractors only.  The specific arrangements for maintaining the security of plant rooms, medication, personal information and valuables are covered elsewhere.  Staff should not enter any restricted areas without appropriate permission.</p>
<p>Access control can also be found on external doors to ensure that, at certain times at least, unauthorised access to the building is prevented.  In order to maintain the security of doors located on a fire escape route, electro-magnetic locks are fitted and connected to the fire alarm system which ensures that they are unlocked should an alarm be activated and an evacuation required.</p>
<p>Nursing staff are responsible for the locking-up procedures of these doors.  These procedures are specified separately.  All staff have a responsibility to ensure that all doors with access control are kept shut at all times unless additional local rules are in force.</p>
<p>In the event of a security breach involving unauthorised access to the property, staff with responsibilities should contact the Police and the Registered Manager.  Under no circumstances should a staff member put themselves at risk of harm.  Efforts should always be made to move residents to a place of safety.  In the event of a reported theft or other type of security breach, the duty nurse must be informed immediately and appropriate procedures followed.</p>

  <h3>PART 3 - Facilities</h3>
<aside>
<p>In this part of the Birtley House health and safety induction, we will be looking at a few specific pieces of plant and equipment that are in general use and require care and consideration.  If your job role involves the use of equipment that has been specifically risk assessed, then further induction and training will be provided as appropriate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Birtley House has three passenger lifts around the building, two in the Nursing Home and one serving Birtley Mews.</li>
<li>Heating is distributed around the building.</li>
<li>Company vehicles.</li>
<li>Parking arrangements.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's look at these items in more detail...</p>
</aside>

<h4>Passenger Lifts</h4>
<p>Birtley House has three passenger lifts around the building, two in the Nursing Home and one serving Birtley Mews.  For anyone entering or leaving the nursing home by stretcher or in a wheelchair that is especially long or bulky, the West Wing lift is the most spacious.</p>
<p>None of the lifts should not be used in the event of a fire or suspected fire.  The West Wing lift is connected to the fire alarm and will automatically descend to the ground floor and shut itself off in the event of an alarm activation.  The other lifts do not have this function.  If you find yourself in a lift and the alarm goes off, please proceed to the nearest floor and follow the fire action procedures.</p>
<p>We encourage residents not to use the lifts by themselves in order to avoid a situation where a residents becomes trapped in a lift that may have malfunctioned.  In these circumstances it would be very hard for our staff to provide any assistance.  For that reason we also ask that staff are vigilant for residents using the lifts on their own and politely offer to accompany any resident wishing to use the lifts.</p>

<h4>Heating & Hot Water</h4>
<p>Heat is distributed throughout the building to a couple of hundred radiators, almost all of which are thermostatically controlled.  This local control allows some degree of adjustment to suit the particular dynamic of that part of the Home or the specific needs of the resident (or indeed staff member).  All staff are encouraged to use commonsense to adjust the radiators using the familair domestic controls that are available to ensure that the Home remains a comfortable temperature.  Certain staff with responsibilities have access to the central heating controls and may, as appropriate, turn off the distribution pumps to one or more areas of the Home.  Should you have an issue with a radiator or require a significant change in the temperature within the Home, please contact the Nurse in Charge.</p>
<p>Hot water temperatures are maintained at a high temperature of 60 degrees or more in order to control Legionella.  Thermostatic controls ensure that at all residential taps, the hot water comes out around 42 degrees C to reduce the risk of scalding.  These temperatures are monitored on a monthly basis.  Should you find that the temperature of a resident's room tap seems too hot or cold, please report this in the Maintenance Book for attention.</p>
<p>Please be aware that, on a number of hot water taps in staff areas, no TMV is present and water could be very hot.  In these instances, warning signs should be visible.</p>

<h4>Company Vehicles & the Company Driving Register</h4>
<p>The Company owns a Renault Kangoo which has been adapted to carry a passenger in a wheelchair. This is used mainly for carrying residents to local appointments, but may, from time to time, be used for outings.  It can also be borrowed by residents' relatives to help facilitate family outings and this is managed by a central booking system administered by the Reception Team.  As a member of the Care Team, you may be required to act as an 'escort' to assist a resident's transport.  Should you be on our Company Driving Register, you would be authorised to drive the vehicle.</p>
<p>The company has a register of drivers who may be required to drive for work purposes.  This may be in their own car or one of the company vehicles.  There are a number of requirements for successful registration, the details of which are specified elsewhere.  Company vehicles cannot be driven by anyone not on the Register.</p>

<h4>Parking Arrangements</h4>
<p>There are some rules around parking that are intended to ensure that residents and visitors have the best possible experience of Birtley House and that anyone with mobility issues can be assured of a parking space as close to the entrance of the Home as possible. To this end, staff are requested to park on gravelled areas of the car park to the periphery of the main tarmac areas.  Staff are requested to be considerate of pedestrians when driving on the premises and to ensure that there is no litter (including cigarette butts) left on the ground.</p>
